<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The main purpose of this Introduction is to give an account of a
movement which changed the whole face of the Irish Church, and to the
advancement of which St. Malachy devoted his life. In default of a
better word we may call the movement a Reformation, though it might
perhaps be more accurately described as an ecclesiastical revolution.
Without some knowledge of its aims and progress it is impossible to
assign to Malachy his true place in the history of his native country.</p>

<p>That such a movement actually took place in the twelfth century is
beyond doubt. From about the year 1200 on it is certain that the
organization of the Church of Ireland was similar to that of the other
Churches of western Christendom. The country was divided into dioceses;
and each diocese had a bishop as its ruler, and a Cathedral Church in
which the bishop's stool was placed. The Cathedral Church, moreover, had
a chapter of clergy, regular or secular, who performed important
functions in the diocese. But up to the end of the eleventh century all
these things were unknown among the Irish. The constitution of the
Church was then of an entirely different type, one that had no exact
parallel elsewhere. The passage from the older to the newer organization
must have taken place in the twelfth century. During that century,
therefore, there was a Reformation in the Irish Church, however little
we may know of its causes or its process. But this Reformation <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>was no
mere re-modelling of the hierarchy. It can be shown that it imposed on
the members of the Church a new standard of sexual morality; if we
believe contemporary writers, it restored to their proper place such
rites as Confession, Confirmation and Matrimony; it substituted for the
offices of divine service previously in use those of the Roman Church;
it introduced the custom of paying tithes; it established in Ireland the
monastic orders of Latin Christendom<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>; and it may have produced
changes in other directions.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> But I propose to confine myself to the
change in the constitution of the Church, which was its most striking
feature. The subject, even thus narrowed, will give us more than can be
satisfactorily treated in a few pages.</p>

<p>First, I must emphasize the assertion made a moment ago that the
constitution of the Irish Church in the eleventh century was <i>sui
generis</i>. Let us begin by reminding ourselves what it was from the sixth
to the eighth century. It was then essentially monastic in character.
The rulers of the Church were the abbots of the monasteries, commonly
known as the coarbs or successors of their founders. These abbots were
sometimes bishops; but whether they were bishops or of lower rank in the
ministry, their authority was inherent in their office of coarb. At this
period bishops were numerous&mdash;more numerous than in later medieval or
modern times; and certain functions were reserved for bishops, for
example, ordination. No ecclesiastic, of whatever status, could perform
such functions, unless he was of the episcopal order. But no bishop, as
such, had jurisdiction. The bishops were often subordinate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>officers in
monasteries, reverenced because of their office, but executing their
special functions at the command of the abbots. Sometimes a bishop was
attached to a single tribe. Sometimes a group of bishops&mdash;often seven in
number&mdash;dwelt together in one place. But in no case, I repeat, had they
jurisdiction. Thus ecclesiastical authority was vested in the abbots.
The episcopate was bestowed on certain individuals as a personal
distinction. Thus the bishops, if they were not also abbots, had only
such influence on the affairs of the Church as their sanctity, or their
learning, might give them.</p>

<p>It may surprise some that so anomalous a system of government should
have persisted as late as the eleventh century, in other words for a
period of over 500 years. But we must take account of the Danish&mdash;or as
we should rather call it, the Norse&mdash;invasion of Ireland. Danish ships
first appeared off the Irish coasts about the year 800. From that time
for two centuries Ireland was to a large extent cut off from intercourse
with the rest of Europe. The aim of the northern hordes, as it seems,
was not mere pillage, but the extinction of Christianity. Ecclesiastical
institutions were everywhere attacked, and often destroyed. And these
institutions were centres of scholarship. Heretofore Ireland had been
the special home of learning, and had attracted to itself large numbers
of foreign students. But in those disastrous centuries its culture was
reduced to the lowest point. In such circumstances it was not possible
that the organization of the Church should be developed or strengthened.
The Danish domination of the country must have tended to stereotype the
old hierarchical system. It might, indeed, suffer from deterioration: it
probably did. But it could not be assimilated to the system which then
prevailed on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>Continent. We should expect that the constitution of
the Church in the eleventh century, whatever abuses may have crept into
its administration, would in principle be identical with that of the
pre-Danish period.</p>

<p>There can in fact be no doubt that it was. We have in our hands writings
of Lanfranc, Anselm, St. Bernard and Giraldus Cambrensis which picture
the state of the Irish Church at that time. They speak of it in terms
which are by no means complimentary. But when they come to details we
discover that the irregularities in its hierarchical arrangement which
shocked them most went back to the days of St. Columba. Quotations
cannot be given here. But the reader will probably find in the Life
printed below, and the authorities referred to in the notes, sufficient
proof that the constitution of the Irish Church in 1100 was in the main
a following, though perhaps a corrupt following, of that of the sixth
century.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>There was indeed one abuse in the Irish Church of the tenth and eleventh
centuries of which few traces are found before the Danish invasion. We
learn from St. Bernard that the abbots of Armagh were the
representatives of a single family, and held office, as of right, by
hereditary succession.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> There is reason to believe that this evil
custom was not peculiar to Armagh.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> According to St. Bernard, it was
the gravest departure from Catholic tradition of which the Irish Church
was guilty, and the parent of many evils. We shall hear more of it in
the sequel. For the moment it is sufficient to note that it existed.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>
<p class="subhead2"><span class="smcap">I.&mdash;The Beginnings of the Movement</span></p>

<p>But before the eleventh century ended forces were at work in Ireland
which prepared the way for the introduction of a new order. They were
set free by the conversion of the Norsemen to Christianity, and by their
final defeat at the battle of Clontarf. The date of the conversion
cannot be fixed: it was probably a gradual process. And we do not know
from what source the Danes derived their Christianity. The victory of
Clontarf was won on Good Friday, 1014.</p>

<p>Now a study of the Annals reveals the fact that in the seventh and
eighth centuries there was a goodly, and on the whole an increasing,
body of scholars in Ireland. Under the Norse domination, as we might
expect, the number was greatly diminished. But already in the tenth
century there was a notable increase: in the eleventh century the number
was doubled. In the tenth century, moreover, and still more in the
eleventh, scholars began to congregate at special centres, which became
permanent homes of learning, the most prominent of these schools being
at Armagh and Clonmacnoise. And during the same period we find frequent
mention of an official, unknown before the arrival of the Norsemen, who
is styled <i>fer l&eacute;gind</i> or professor. Between 925 and 1000 the obits of
twenty-three professors are recorded; in the eleventh century of more
than fifty. In the greater number of cases the <i>fer l&eacute;gind</i> is
associated with one of those seats of learning which is known to have
been most prolific of scholars.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that gradually, as the onslaughts of the Danes became
less frequent, Irish men of learning tended more and more to become
teachers rather than mere students, and to gravitate towards a few great
centres of study. The climax of this movement towards <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>organization and
the eminence of special places was reached about the middle of the
eleventh century (1030-1063), when mention is made of thirty-three
persons who held the office of <i>fer l&eacute;gind</i>, and when the principal
schools seem to have been those of Clonmacnoise, Armagh, Kildare and
Kells.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>The Reformation of the twelfth century, like that of the sixteenth, was
prepared for by a revival of learning.</p>

<p>But further, the defeat of the Danes removed the barrier which had
hindered communication between Ireland and the rest of Europe. Students
once more came to Ireland from other lands to pursue their studies. The
most remarkable of these was perhaps Sulien, the future bishop of St.
David's. Sulien the Wise was born shortly before the date of the battle
of Clontarf in the district of Cardigan. In early youth he displayed
much aptitude for learning, and in middle life, about 1058, "stirred by
the example of the fathers," he paid a visit to the Irish schools in
order to perfect his studies. He spent thirteen years in that country,
and then established a famous school at Llanbadarn Fawr in Wales. In the
library of Trinity College, Dublin, there is a precious relic of the
work of this school. It is a beautiful manuscript of St. Jerome's Latin
version of the Psalter according to the Hebrew, once the property of
Bishop Bedell.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The manuscript was written by a member of the school,
a Welshman named Ithael. It is adorned with excellent illuminations by
John, one of Sulien's sons, and was presented to Ricemarch, another son
of Sulien. A valuable copy of the Hieronymian Martyrology prefixed to it
gives sundry indications that it was transcribed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>from an Irish
exemplar. At the end of the volume are some verses composed by
Ricemarch, and perhaps written there by his own hand. They display
considerable Biblical and patristic learning. Another relic of the
school is a copy of St. Augustine's <i>De Trinitate</i> in Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> It was written and illuminated by John, and
contains excellent Latin verses from his pen. In the British Museum
there is also a poem of Ricemarch describing the horrors of the Norman
invasion of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> And finally we have a <i>Life of St. David</i>, by the
same author. It relates many incidents culled from the lives of Irish
saints who had in one way or another been brought into contact with
David; all of them reminiscent of Sulien's studies in the Irish
Schools.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>I have dwelt on these things because they illustrate in a striking way
the revival of Irish learning in the eleventh century. But just at the
time when Sulien, and doubtless many other foreigners, were coming to
Ireland to study, Irish scholars were beginning to renew their ancient
habit of travelling to other countries. By way of example I may mention
two, both of whom were known by the same name, Marianus Scotus. One of
these, a native of the north of Ireland, whose real name was Muiredach
Mac Robartaich, founded the monastery of St. Peter at Ratisbon about
1070; and he was succeeded there by six abbots of north Irish birth. He
wrote a commentary on the Pauline Epistles, which is still preserved in
the Imperial Library at Vienna. The other, Mael Brigte by name, left
Ireland in 1056, and after some wanderings established himself at Mainz
in 1069. He compiled a chronicle, which is of considerable <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>value.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
Hereafter I shall have to mention other Irish men of travel; and it will
be seen that from some of them, who returned home, came the main impulse
to the reform of the Irish Church.</p>

<p>The battle of Clontarf broke the power of the Danes in Ireland; but it
did not secure their departure from the country. Those that remained
were mainly settled in the four cities of Dublin, Wexford, Waterford and
Limerick. In due time these four Danish colonies adopted the Christian
Faith, and before long they became organized churches, each presided
over by a bishop. In Dublin this took place a quarter of a century after
the battle of Clontarf, the first bishop being Dunan, in whose
episcopate the Danish king, Sitric, founded the Cathedral of the Holy
Trinity about 1040. Of the early ecclesiastical history of Wexford
practically nothing is known; but the first bishop of Waterford was
consecrated in 1096,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and the first bishop of Limerick eight or ten
years later.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> These were the first churches in Ireland ruled by
bishops who were not abbots; and it seems that each of the bishops had a
defined diocese. The dioceses of Dublin, Waterford, and perhaps Wexford,
were very small, extending only a little way, if at all, beyond the
walls of the Cathedral city. The diocese of Limerick, on the other hand,
was extensive; rather larger than the present diocese of the same name.
But whether large or small each of these dioceses presented to the eyes
of the Irish a model of Church government similar to that in vogue on
the Continent, and utterly different from that to which they were
accustomed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>This might prove a potent factor in the Reformation, once a tendency
developed among the Irish to bring their ecclesiastical machinery into
conformity with that of the rest of the world. But it is manifest that
by itself it would not induce them to re-model their hierarchy. It was
not to be expected that they would cast aside the tradition of
centuries, moved merely by a desire to imitate their late enemies. If,
as is commonly held, the Danish dioceses, without exception, held
themselves aloof from, or were hostile to, Irish Christianity, such a
result could hardly have been attained, at any rate until the coming of
the Anglo-Normans. These later invaders would doubtless have forced
diocesan episcopacy on the Irish Church. But that it was established in
Ireland before the country came, even in part, under English rule, is
certain. So we must ask the question: What was the connecting link which
bound the Church of the Danish colonists to that of Celtic Ireland? By
way of answer I point to the remarkable fact, often overlooked, that all
the earliest bishops of the Danish dioceses were of Irish birth. Why
Danish Christians should have elected Irishmen as their bishops I do not
attempt to explain. But the evidence for the fact is clear.</p>

<p>The first two bishops of Dublin, Dunan and Patrick (Gilla P&aacute;traic), had
unmistakably Irish names. So too had their immediate successors Donough
O'Hanley and his nephew Samuel O'Hanley; and of these two the latter is
stated by the English chronicler Eadmer<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> to have been "natione
Hibernensis." The next bishop, Gregory&mdash;the first archbishop of
Dublin&mdash;was likewise "natione Hibernensis" according to the continuator
of Florence of Worcester.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> He was followed by St.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>Laurence O'Toole,
of whose nationality it is unnecessary to give proof.</p>

<p>Malchus, the earliest bishop of Waterford, was an Irishman;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> so also
was Gilbert, the first bishop of Limerick. And when Gilbert resigned his
see, after an episcopate of thirty-five years, he was succeeded by
Patrick, whose name tells its own tale.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Most of the Irish rulers of Danish dioceses whom I have mentioned were
men of travel. Patrick of Dublin, to whose learning Lanfranc bears
testimony, "was nourished in monastic institutions from his
boyhood,"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> and certainly not, in an Irish religious house. Donough
O'Hanley, before his consecration, was a monk of Canterbury; Samuel
O'Hanley was a monk of St. Albans;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Malchus was called to Waterford
from Walkelin's monastery at Winchester;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Gilbert of Limerick had
visited Normandy,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and at a later date we find him assisting at the
consecration of a bishop in Westminster Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Such men had had
training which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>familiarized them with Roman methods of Church
Government. They were well fitted to organize and rule their dioceses.
And if they desired to imbue the Celtic Church with the principles which
they had learnt, and on which they acted, their nationality gave them a
ground of appeal which no Dane could have had. It is of course not to be
assumed that all of them were so disposed. The Danish Christians of
Dublin not only stood aside from the Celtic Church; for reasons which
will appear later they were inimical to it, and it to them. Their
bishops, with the possible exception of the first, made profession of
canonical obedience to the English Primates. Not only so: they gloried
in their subjection to Canterbury. "We have always been willing subjects
of your predecessors," wrote the burgesses and clergy of Dublin to
Ralph, archbishop of Canterbury, when the see was vacant in 1121. And
then, after a reference to the great jealousy of Cellach of Armagh
against them, they proceed to declare, "We will not obey his command,
but desire to be always under your rule. Therefore we beseech you to
promote Gregory to the episcopate if you wish to retain any longer the
parish which we have kept for you so long."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> It was clearly
impossible that this diocese could directly influence the Irish in the
direction of reform. But no such obstacle barred the path of the first
bishops of Limerick and Waterford. Gilbert owed no allegiance to
Canterbury; Malchus was consecrated at Canterbury, but he soon escaped
his profession of obedience to Anselm.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>Both became leaders of the
romanizing movement in Ireland.</p>

<p>But the influence of the Danish dioceses on the Irish Church was not
limited to the personal action of their bishops. Indirectly all of them,
including Dublin, had a share in promoting the Reformation. Archbishop
Lanfranc, as early as 1072, claimed that his primacy included Ireland as
well as England.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> The claim, curiously enough, was based on Bede's
<i>History</i>, in which there is not a single word which supports it. But
the arrival two years later of Patrick, elect of Dublin, seeking
consecration at his hands, gave him his opportunity to enforce it. When
Patrick returned to take possession of his see he carried with him two
letters from Lanfranc. One was addressed to Gothric, the Manx prince who
for the moment was king of Dublin. Lanfranc, with tactful exaggeration,
dubs him "glorious king of Ireland," and tells him that in consecrating
Patrick he had followed the custom of his predecessors in the chair of
St. Augustine. The other letter was more important. It was directed to
Turlough O'Brien, grandson of Brian Boroimhe, who is also styled,
inconsistently, and not altogether truly, "magnificent king of Ireland":
he was doubtless king of Ireland in hope, but in fact he never extended
his sway beyond the southern half of the island. Turlough's attention is
called to the irregularities of the Irish Church. He is urged to call a
council of bishops and religious men for the extirpation of those evil
customs, and to be present at it in person. This letter evidently
produced an impression, and not only on Turlough O'Brien. For a few
years later Lanfranc wrote another letter, this time to a bishop named
Donnell and others, who had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>sought his advice on a difficult question
concerning the sacrament of baptism.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Anselm followed in the footsteps of Lanfranc. Not long after his
consecration (1093) he wrote to Donnell, Donough O'Hanley and the rest
of the bishops of Ireland, begging the aid of their prayers, and urging
them to consult him in all cases of difficulty. Almost immediately
afterwards came the election of Malchus, bishop of Waterford, in 1096.
Among those who signed the petition for his consecration were Bishop
Donnell, Samuel O'Hanley, whom Anselm had consecrated for Dublin earlier
in the same year, and O'Dunan, bishop of Meath (<i>Idunan episcopus
Midiae</i>), whose name we shall do well to remember. But most notable of
all were Murtough O'Brien, son of Turlough, then the strongest of Irish
kings, soon to be <i>ardr&iacute;</i>, and his brother Dermot O'Brien.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> It is
clear that Lanfranc had won the O'Briens to the Romanizing side; and
Anselm was determined to hold them fast. Within the next few years there
was a fairly regular correspondence between him and Murtough, of which
some letters have been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> The relation between the two men
was evidently most friendly. And the archbishop fully exploited his
opportunity. Again and again he reminded the king of his duty to repress
abuses, the most important of which in his eyes were lax sexual
morality, and the consecration of bishops by single bishops, without
fixed sees or defined dioceses.</p>

<p>So Lanfranc and Anselm schooled the O'Briens in the principles of Rome.
And from one point of view their efforts were completely successful. The
O'Briens <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>became staunch friends of the Reform movement in Ireland. But
from another point of view they failed. We must remember that their aim
was not only to purify the Irish Church, but to bring it into subjection
to Canterbury. That they did not succeed in doing. The Reformation,
which they taught the O'Briens to support, meant, in the end, a
repudiation of the pretensions of the English primates.</p>

<p>I have mentioned among those who were concerned in the election of
Malchus of Waterford, O'Dunan, bishop of Meath. He is unquestionably
M&aacute;el Muire Ua Dun&aacute;in, whom the annalists describe as "learned bishop of
the Goidhil, and head of the clergy of Ireland, and steward of the
almsdeeds of the world," and who died on Christmas Eve, 1117, at the age
of seventy-six. He is mentioned in a charter in the Book of Kells, the
date of which is apparently about 1100, as Senior of Leath Chuinn
(<i>i.e.</i> the north of Ireland).<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> He was fifty-five when Malchus was
elected, and had probably already attained the eminence throughout
Ireland which is attested by the high-flown phrases of the Annals. That
he was then bishop of Meath in the modern sense is impossible; the title
at that period would mean no more than that he was a bishop who lived
within the borders of the Kingdom of Meath. But the <i>Annals of
Tigernach</i> tell us that he died at Clonard, from which it may perhaps be
inferred that his see was at that place. His importance for us just now
is that he is the only adherent of the Reform movement whom we have yet
discovered in the north of Ireland.</p>

<p class="subhead2"><span class="smcap">II.&mdash;The First Stage</span></p>

<p>Before proceeding further in our investigation of the origin and course
of the Reformation, it may be well to recall how far we have already
advanced. We started from the fact that a Reformation of the Irish
Church was actually accomplished in the twelfth century, and we
proceeded to look for the causes which may have brought it about. We
have found that the first of these was the revival of learning
consequent on the cessation of the ravages of the Norsemen. We have
noted also the restoration at the same period of communication between
Ireland and the rest of Europe&mdash;the coming of students to the Irish
schools, and the wanderings of Irish scholars in other lands. We have
seen that the establishment of the Danish dioceses gave to the Irish a
model of diocesan episcopacy, and that among the Irish-born bishops of
those dioceses there were men capable of leading a Reform movement. And
we have learned that Lanfranc and Anselm, through their relation with
the Danish dioceses, found means to induce the more conspicuous civil
and religious leaders of the Celtic population to undertake the work of
reconstituting the Church. Finally, we have been able to name some
persons who might be expected to take a prominent place in the early
stages of the Reformation. They are Gilbert of Limerick, Malchus of
Waterford, O'Dunan of Meath, and the princes of the O'Brien family. The
best proof that we have rightly conceived the origin of the movement
will come before us when we study the share which these persons
severally had in promoting it.</p>

<p>We must now trace, as far as it can be done, the first steps in the
process by which, under the influences <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>which I have indicated, the
Church of Ireland passed from its older to its later hierarchical
system.</p>

<p>The earliest attempt to give concrete form to the principles of the
Reformers seems to have been made in the Kingdom of Meath, about the
year 1100. But the primary evidence for the fact is of much later date.
There are extant some constitutions of Simon Rochfort, bishop of Meath,
put forth at a synod of his diocese held at the monastery of SS. Peter
and Paul at Newtown, near Trim, in 1216. The first of them recites an
ordinance of the papal legate, Cardinal John Paparo, at the Council of
Kells in 1152, which is of great importance.</p>

<p>Paparo ordered that as the bishops of the weaker sees died off,
arch-priests, or, as we call them, rural deans, should succeed to their
place, and take charge of the clergy and people within their
borders.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The inference which this enactment suggests is that the weaker sees to
which it refers were the centres of small dioceses, which Paparo desired
to be converted into rural deaneries. In accordance with the ordinance
of Paparo, Rochfort's synod enjoined that rural deans should be placed
in the five sees of Trim, Kells, Slane, Skreen and Dunshaughlin, each of
whom should supervise the churches in his own deanery. These, with
Clonard, which had long been the see of Rochfort's diocese, are six of
the twelve rural deaneries into which the present diocese of Meath is
divided.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> I conclude that they, and probably the remaining six,
coincided <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>more or less closely with dioceses ruled by bishops in the
first half of the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>Let us now call to our aid a much earlier witness. The annalists inform
us that in the year 1111 there was an assembly at Usnagh in Meath. It
decreed that "the parishes<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> of Meath" should be equally divided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>between the bishops of Clonmacnoise and Clonard. We may infer that
Clonmacnoise and Clonard, two of the present rural deaneries, were then
dioceses. It is not likely that the dioceses of Meath would have been
formed into two groups, each to constitute the diocese of a bishop who
had already no diocese of his own. But however that may be, we have here
proof that before 1111 Meath had been parted into a number of small
dioceses ruled by bishops.</p>

<p>If the question be asked, By whose authority or influence this division
of Meath into dioceses was made? I can suggest no one more likely than
M&aacute;el Muire Ua Dun&aacute;in, the "bishop of Meath" to whom reference has
already been made.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> He was a Meath man, and probably bishop of
Clonard: he was an ecclesiastic of great repute, especially in the
north; and he was a devoted adherent of the Reform movement. His action,
if indeed it was his, was premature and ill-advised. As we shall see,
his work had to be slowly undone. But it is remarkable, as the first
attempt known to us to establish diocesan episcopacy among the Irish. I
shall have more to say about it hereafter; but now I must follow the
main stream of events.</p>

<p>Gilbert,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> the first bishop of Limerick, as has already been noted,
was an Irishman. Indeed, we may venture to describe him as one of the
most remarkable Irishmen of his time, in spite of the fact that the
Annals pass him by in almost complete silence. He was at any rate a
staunch supporter, or, as we should rather say, the leader of the
Reformation movement in its earliest course. In a letter written in 1107
Anselm exhorted him, in virtue of their mutual friendship, to make good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>use of his episcopal office by correcting that which was amiss, and
planting and sowing good customs, calling to aid him in the work his
king (Murtough O'Brien), the other Irish bishops, and all whom he could
persuade.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> That, assuredly, Gilbert was forward to do.</p>

<p>No sooner had he taken possession of his see than he began to organize a
diocese. Its boundaries seem to have been fixed with care. It was
exactly co-extensive with the modern diocese of Limerick, except on the
north, where it stretched across the Shannon and included part of the
present diocese of Killaloe.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Moreover he made the Church of St. Mary
his Cathedral Church; indeed it is not unlikely that he built it to
serve that purpose.</p>

<p>A few years later he was appointed Legate of the Holy See. It is
manifest that his new office gave him a unique opportunity of moulding
the fortunes of the Irish Church. In Ireland Gilbert was now virtually
the chief prelate and head of the Church. He was the representative and
embodiment of the authority of the Holy See. The whole Romanizing party
would naturally circle round him as their leader, and many waverers
would be attracted to the new movement in the Irish Church, by the claim
which he could make to speak in the name of the head of the Church
Catholic.</p>

<p>It was after he became legate, and no doubt in virtue of his legatine
commission, that he issued a treatise which may be regarded as the
programme of the Reformation. It is entitled <i>De Statu Ecclesiae</i>. Of
this a fragment, including its earlier chapters, is still in our
hands.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>Before giving a slight summary of its contents I must mention that it is
addressed "to the bishops and presbyters of the whole of Ireland," and
that Gilbert declares that he wrote it at the urgent request of many of
them. In this statement there may lurk an element of exaggeration. But
behind it there lies at least so much truth as this. A considerable body
of the clergy had approached the newly made legate, and requested his
instruction regarding the proper constitution of the Church&mdash;for such is
the subject of his tract; and that implies that the Romanizing movement
was no longer in its infancy. There were many bishops and presbyters who
had become dissatisfied with the old Irish method of Church government.
They desired to bring it into conformity with that of the Roman Church.
But they were in some uncertainty as to the nature of the changes that
should be made, and so they asked Gilbert to give them authoritative
counsel.</p>

<p>In reply to their petition, with the aid of an elaborate diagram, he
sketched as follows the organization of a properly ordered Church.</p>

<p>The bishops, he tells us, and others of higher rank in the ministry
belong to the general Church, as distinct from particular churches. The
priest is the highest officer in a particular church. It is the primary
duty of every priest to serve and obey his bishop with all humility. For
by the bishops particular churches are ruled. To each bishop are subject
all the churches within his jurisdiction. And this applies as well to
monastic establishments as to parishes. The head of each parish is a
priest, the head of each monastery is an abbot, who is himself a priest.
The bishop has a pontifical church, in which is his see (<i>sedes</i>), and
of which he is the head. From it he governs the inferior churches. A
bishop can perform all the offices of a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>priest, but he has seven
functions peculiar to himself: to confirm, to bless, to absolve, to hold
synods, to dedicate churches and altars, to consecrate the ornaments of
churches, to ordain abbots and abbesses and the secular clergy.
Gilbert's diagram represented the bishop as ruling two churches; but he
explains that this is to be interpreted figuratively. A bishop may have
as many as a thousand churches within his jurisdiction: he must have at
least ten.</p>

<p>A bishop is himself subject to authority. His immediate superior is the
archbishop. An archbishop has a sphere of immediate jurisdiction, like
any other bishop, but he also rules a number of subject bishops. Of
these there must be at least three; but an archbishop is not permitted
to have more than twenty subject bishops&mdash;an important point, as we
shall see. Above the archbishop is the primate. It is the special
privilege of the primate to ordain and crown the king. He too has his
sphere of immediate jurisdiction, and he must have at least one subject
archbishop, but not more than six.</p>

<p>Primates and archbishops must be consecrated at Rome by the Pope, or at
least must receive the pall<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> from him. Without the pall they are not
raised above their fellow-bishops.</p>

<p>Finally, the primates are subject to the Pope, and the Pope to Christ.</p>

<p>The higher members of the hierarchy have their analogues in the civil
order. The Pope corresponds to the emperor, the primate to the king, an
archbishop to a duke, a bishop to an earl, a priest to a knight. But all
these are merely grades of the order of priests. There are but seven
orders of the ministry&mdash;priests, deacons, sub-deacons, acolytes,
exorcists, readers and door-keepers. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>Of the laity Gilbert says little.
They are of two classes; husbandmen and soldiers. Their duties are to
attend church, to pay first-fruits, tithes and oblations, to avoid evil
and do good, and to obey their pastors.</p>

<p>There is nothing original in all this; and some parts of it must have
been very puzzling to stay-at-home Irishmen. For example, what were they
to make of Gilbert's comparison of primates, archbishops, bishops and
priests to kings, dukes, earls and knights? They knew as little of dukes
and earls in the civil order as they did of primates and archbishops in
the ecclesiastical; and they had far more kings than suited Gilbert's
scheme. But the tract is important, both as a summary of the teaching
which Gilbert had no doubt been inculcating far and wide for years, and
as a permanent record, for future use, of the aims of the Reformers.</p>

<p>However unintelligible the treatise may have been in parts, it brought
out with startling clearness one or two essential points. First the
Church must be ruled by bishops. Even the monasteries are subject to
them. How amazing such a statement must have sounded to men who had
inherited the tradition, many centuries old, that the abbots of
monasteries were the true ecclesiastical rulers, bishops their
subordinate officials.</p>

<p>Moreover, bishoprics and dioceses could not be set up at random. The
number of bishops and by consequence the size of dioceses must be
carefully considered. The puny bishoprics of Meath, for example, could
form no part of a scheme such as Gilbert adumbrated.</p>

<p>It was manifest that if his guidance were to be followed, no mere
modification of existing arrangements would suffice. The old hierarchy
must be torn up by the roots, and a new hierarchy planted in its place.</p>

<p>We shall meet Gilbert again in the course of our story. But we may now
turn aside from him to make the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>acquaintance of a new actor in the
drama of the Reformation. Like O'Dunan he was a Northern.</p>

<p>Cellach was born in 1080. He was an Armagh man, sprung from the family
which for centuries past had provided abbots for the monastery of that
city, the grandson of a former abbot. He first appears on the scene in
1105, when on the death of Abbot Donnell he became coarb of Patrick and
abbot of Armagh. He was elected, we may assume, in the customary way. He
was then under twenty-six years of age, and was apparently still a
layman. But his subsequent action shows that he was already a convinced
disciple of the new movement. Doubtless he had fallen under the spell of
Gilbert of Limerick. Six weeks after his election he abandoned the
tradition of a century and a half, and received holy orders. But in
other respects he trod in the footsteps of his predecessors. In the
following year he went on a circuit of the Cen&eacute;l Eoghain, and "took away
his full demand: namely, a cow for every six, or an in-calf heifer for
every three, or a half ounce of silver for every four, besides many
donations also." Next he proceeded to Munster, with similar results. But
his circuit of Munster is important for other reasons. There he had
opportunities of intercourse with his Munster friends, Gilbert of
Limerick and Malchus of Waterford. And with that circuit we may connect
two incidents of the highest significance. In 1106, apparently in the
latter part of the year, Caincomrac Ua Baigill, bishop of Armagh, died.
The news of his death probably reached Cellach while he was in the
south. Certainly in Munster Cellach was consecrated bishop. It is
impossible not to connect the latter event with the former. He was
consecrated to fill the vacancy created by the death of O'Boyle. Thus he
was now bishop of Armagh as well as coarb of Patrick. In his own person
he united the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>two lines of coarbial and episcopal succession, which had
parted asunder in 957, when the first of a series of lay coarbs had been
elected, and the first of the six contemporary bishops had been
consecrated.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> This was a great gain for the Reformers. The old
anomaly of a ruler of the Church who was not a bishop had, so far as
Armagh was concerned, disappeared for the time. And Armagh was the
principal ecclesiastical centre in Ireland. Cellach might now call
himself archbishop of Armagh, though he had not fulfilled the condition
laid down by Gilbert, that an archbishop must receive the pall at the
hands of the Pope. The title was actually accorded to him by so rigid a
papalist as St. Bernard.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>But there was more to come. In the year 1101 there had been held at
Cashel a great assembly of the clergy and people of Ireland. Bishop
O'Dunan, whom we already know, was at their head. To it came also
Murtough O'Brien, who earlier in the year, after an expedition in force
through Connaught and Ulster, had entered Tara as <i>ardr&iacute;</i> of
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> In the presence of the assembly he surrendered Cashel, the
royal city of the kings of Munster, to the Church, as an offering to God
and St. Patrick.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> When we consider the persons who were concerned in
this transaction we find good ground for the suspicion that the gift was
intended in some way to benefit the movement for reform. Now St. Bernard
informs us that Cellach created a second archiepiscopal see in Ireland
in subordination to Armagh.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> After his manner he does not tell us
where it was situated. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>It is certain, however, that it was at Cashel,
which was the seat of an archbishop in 1110.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> It was probably
surrendered for this very purpose by O'Brien. And if it be asked when
Cellach erected it into an archbishopric the answer is scarcely
doubtful. Only once, so far as we know, did Cellach enter Munster before
1110. It was on the occasion of his circuit. In the year of the circuit,
therefore, 1106, the archbishopric of Cashel was founded. In that same
year, or shortly afterwards, Malchus of Waterford was translated to the
new see, and became its first archbishop. There is no evidence that a
new bishop was consecrated for Waterford in succession to Malchus: this
indeed is unlikely. But it should be noted that by his acceptance of an
archbishopric subject to Armagh, Malchus was released from the
profession of obedience which he had made to Anselm ten years earlier.
He was now a bishop of the Church of Ireland, with undivided allegiance.</p>

<p>The reason for the creation of a second archbishopric is not difficult
to guess. By this time the plans of the Reformers must have been in some
degree matured: before long, as we shall see, they were set forth in
minute detail. Already Cellach was archbishop of Armagh. His suffragan
sees, indeed, apart from those formed by O'Dunan, if their bishops
acknowledged themselves as his suffragans, were <i>in nubibus</i>. But
suffragan sees he must have, according to the theory of Gilbert, each
with a diocese attached to it. They must be at least three in number,
but <i>not more than twenty</i>. Now it was a foregone conclusion that if the
Reformers had their way there would be more than twenty dioceses in
Ireland. Hence, by Gilbert's rule, there must be a second archbishop.
Moreover, by making the archbishopric of Cashel subject to Armagh,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>Cellach secured for himself and his successors a title yet more imposing
than that of archbishop. He was now Primate of Ireland; for it sufficed,
if Gilbert spoke truly, that a primate should have one subject
archbishop. As coarb of Patrick Cellach's authority ranged over the
whole country; as primate his sway would be no less extensive. He
actually claimed the title, if not then, at least a few years later.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>We may now for a while leave Gilbert and Cellach and Malchus and
O'Dunan. With Gilbert as legate, and Cellach and Malchus as archbishops;
with dioceses already formed at Limerick and Waterford and in Meath,
probably also at Armagh and Cashel and Wexford; with the great extension
of the movement, and its spread from Munster to Meath and Ulster, all
was ready for the meeting of the Synod whose ordinances should give
definite shape to the policy to be pursued in the future.</p>


<p class="subhead2"><span class="smcap">III.&mdash;The Synod of Rathbreasail</span></p>

<p>Geoffrey Keating quotes from the lost <i>Annals of Clonenagh</i> an account
of a national Synod or Council held at Rathbreasail in the year
1110.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The existing Annals record that a national Council met at
Fiadh meic Oengusa in 1111. With the exception of the <i>Annals of
Inisfallen</i>, none of them mention Rathbreasail; but the Inisfallen
annalist tells us that it is another name for Fiadh meic Oengusa.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> I
shall assume therefore that there were not two national Synods in
successive years, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>but one; and, following the <i>Annals of Clonenagh</i>, I
shall call it the Synod of Rathbreasail, and date it in 1110.</p>

<p>The Synod of Rathbreasail marks the beginning of the second stage of the
Reformation movement. It was convened by the papal legate; its purpose
was the Romanizing of the Irish Church, and, in particular, the
establishment in it of diocesan episcopacy. Fortunately Keating's
excerpts from its Acts give us ample information concerning the canons
which dealt with this matter.</p>

<p>The annalists, as I have said, describe the council as a national
assembly. But we can hardly claim so much for it. It is much more
probable that it was in reality a meeting of the Reforming party. The
first signature appended to its canons was that of Gilbert, who presided
as legate of the Holy See. He was followed by Cellach, "coarb of Patrick
and Primate of Ireland," and Malchus, "archbishop of Cashel," whom we
have known as bishop of Waterford. The signatures of many bishops
followed, but they have not been preserved. We know, however, that
Bishop O'Dunan was present, as was also Murtough O'Brien, king of
Ireland. These were all leaders of the Reforming party; and it is
evident that they guided the deliberations of the Council. Moreover
there were no representatives of the provinces of Connaught and
Leinster, in which as yet, it appears, the Reform movement had not
established itself. That is made clear by notes appended to canons which
specially concerned those provinces. One of them begins thus: "If the
Connaught clergy agree to this ... we desire it, and if they do not"&mdash;in
that case they may do as they please, with certain limitations. The
clergy of Leinster are accorded a similar liberty. It is obvious that if
among the members of the Council there had been men who could speak with
authority <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>for the provinces mentioned such notes need not, and
therefore could not, have been written. The Council represented Munster,
Ulster and Meath. It was national, not because it could speak for all
Ireland, but because it made laws for all Ireland.</p>

<p>I must now give an account of those laws, so far as they relate to the
organization of the Church. I follow the <i>Annals of Clonenagh</i>, as
reported by Keating: but in two or three places I have been obliged to
amend his text.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>The fathers began by appealing to English precedent. "Just as twelve
bishops were fixed under Canterbury in the south of England, and twelve
bishops in the north under the city of York," so it was ordained that
there should be twelve bishops in the south of Ireland, and twelve in
the north. The constitution of the Irish Church was henceforth, it would
seem, to be a copy of that of the English Church. But, as it happens,
neither in 1110 nor in any other year of its history, had the Church of
England twelve sees under Canterbury and twelve under York. How then can
we explain the statement of the Synod? The answer is simple. Bede<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
preserves a letter of Pope Gregory the Great, written in 601, in which
St. Augustine of Canterbury was directed to consecrate twelve bishops as
his own suffragans. He was also ordered to consecrate a bishop for York,
who, if his mission proved successful, was likewise to consecrate twelve
suffragans, and to be promoted to the dignity of a metropolitan. It is
clear that the Synod found its precedent in this letter, not observing
that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>Pope Gregory's ordinance was never carried into effect. But they
made another mistake. For Gregory intended that there should be twelve
bishops in the north of England, and twelve in the south, exclusive of
the archbishops, twenty-six in all; while it is evident that the Council
of Rathbreasail intended that there should be twelve bishops in the
north of Ireland, and twelve in the south, including the archbishops,
twenty-four in all. Some one whose lead the Synod followed&mdash;probably the
papal legate&mdash;had read his Bede with little care. But that is not
surprising. Lanfranc had misread Bede, when on his authority he claimed
to be Primate of Ireland; why should not Gilbert have gone astray in
like fashion? The point to be noticed and emphasized is that the first
act of the Synod was to fix the number of the Irish sees, on the curious
principle that what the wisdom of Pope Gregory held to be good for
England would suit Ireland also.</p>

<p>Apparently the next step in the procedure was to determine the
distribution of the dioceses among the provinces, and to fix the see of
each prospective diocese. Ireland was divided into two portions by a
line running, approximately, from Dublin to Galway. The part to the
north of that line was known as Leath Chuinn, the part to the south as
Leath Mogha. In Leath Chuinn were the provinces of Ulster and Connaught
and the kingdom of Meath; in Leath Mogha were the provinces of Munster
and Leinster. The Synod decreed that there should be five sees in
Ulster, five in Connaught, and two in Meath, making twelve bishoprics
for Leath Chuinn; there were to be seven in Munster and five in
Leinster&mdash;twelve bishoprics for Leath Mogha. The names of all these sees
were given in the Acts of the Synod.</p>

<p>Finally the Synod defined the boundaries of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>dioceses to which the
sees severally belonged. It is not my purpose to give a minute
description of these boundaries. That would involve an excursus on Irish
topography, which would be, to say the least, out of place. It will
suffice to indicate roughly those of the five dioceses of Ulster. To the
west was what was called the "parish" (<i>fairche</i>)<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> of Derry or
Raphoe. It was nearly identical with our diocese of Raphoe. The only
important difference is that it included Inishowen, the district between
Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle, which now belongs to the diocese of Derry.
Next to the parish of Derry or Raphoe the Synod placed the parish of
Ardstraw.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Ardstraw never became the see, and the diocese was
subsequently known as "of Derry." It extended eastward to the
Carntougher Mountains, and coincides pretty closely with the present
diocese. It subsequently gained Inishowen from its western neighbour,
and the strip between the Carntougher Mountains and the Bann from its
eastern neighbour. But otherwise it remains much as the Synod of
Rathbreasail determined. Next to it was to be the parish of Connor or
Down. When the portion of it to the west of the Bann was transferred to
Derry, it coincided almost exactly with the modern Down, Connor and
Dromore. On the other hand the parish of Armagh seems originally to have
included the modern county of Monaghan: it has shrunk to little more
than half its size. The parish of Clogher, at first very small, has
extended east and west, and is three times as large as it was intended
to be. On the whole the work of the Synod has stood well the test of
many centuries of history.</p>

<p>It is indeed wonderful that it should have done so. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>For the method of
the Synod&mdash;fixing the number of the dioceses before their boundaries
were discussed&mdash;was unstatesmanlike. Always, and necessarily,
ecclesiastical divisions have coincided with civil divisions. We may
find the germ of the rule in the Acts of the Apostles.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> If this was
inevitable in other lands it was even more inevitable in Ireland in
pre-Norman days. The Irish people was a collection of clans, having, it
is true, certain common institutions, but bound together by no sort of
national constitution, and often at war with each other. If
ecclesiastical divisions were to be permanent in Ireland, they must take
account of the tribal divisions of the country. The primary
ecclesiastical unit must be the territory of a tribe, just as it was the
primary civil unit.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> But to base the limits of dioceses, consistently
and in every case, on tribal boundaries was impossible when the number
of dioceses was arbitrarily fixed beforehand. It could not be that
exactly the same number of dioceses would suit Ulster as suited Leinster
and Connaught. In one province the tribes would be more or less
numerous, and more or less mutually antagonistic, than in another. By
reason of its method, therefore, the Synod was doomed to fall short of
complete success in its work.</p>

<p>We have instances in Ulster of the soundness of the principle that I
have stated. Take the diocese of Raphoe. It was designed to include
Inishowen. But from a tribal point of view Inishowen (Inis Eoghain)
belonged to the next diocese, which included the tribeland of T&iacute;r
Eoghain. Its inhabitants were of the same <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>stock as the Cen&eacute;l Eoghain,
and were known as the Cen&eacute;l Eoghain of the Island. So the natural result
followed. Inishowen broke off from the diocese of Raphoe and became part
of the diocese of Derry. When this happened the diocese of Raphoe was
stabilized. It consisted of the land of a single tribe, the Cen&eacute;l
Conaill; and so henceforth its limits were never altered.</p>

<p>We can easily understand, therefore, that the disregard of tribal
boundaries, forced on it in many cases by its method, was an element of
weakness in the Rathbreasail scheme. And yet it was natural that special
stress should be laid on the arbitrary limitation of sees which was its
main cause. Ireland was overrun with bishops. It is said that over fifty
of them attended the Synod of Rathbreasail; and they represented only
part of the country. But Gilbert had laid down the rule that an
archbishop could not have more than twenty suffragans. On this
principle, if all the existing bishops had been provided with dioceses,
or all the larger tribes had been given bishops, Ireland would have had
not two, but six or seven archbishops: and this would have been a
travesty of Catholic Church order, as it was then understood. It was
essential that the number should be ruthlessly cut down.</p>

<p>But the legislators of Rathbreasail did not entirely ignore tribal
boundaries. On the contrary, so far as the numerical basis of their
scheme permitted, they took them into account. And here we find that the
Synod was confronted with another difficulty. The territories of tribes
were fluctuating quantities. Hence, even if a diocese was the district
of a single tribe, with very definite boundaries, no one could be sure
that in the course of years its limits would not change. Again I take an
example from Ulster. The Synod selected the Carntougher Mountains as the
boundary between the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>dioceses of Derry and Connor. And wisely. For
between those mountains and the Bann there dwelt a sept&mdash;the Fir
Li&mdash;whose affinities were altogether with the people to the east of the
river. But only a few years after the Synod that territory was overrun
by the O'Kanes of the Roe Valley, and the Fir Li retreated across the
Bann, never to return. The result followed which might have been
expected. Their territory was transferred from Connor to Derry, and the
Bann to this day is the boundary of the two dioceses.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>It may be well, before I pass to another subject, to call attention to
some special features of the Rathbreasail canons.</p>

<p>First, let us note the prominence which is given to Limerick, the
diocese of Gilbert, the president of the Synod. Usually a diocese is
somewhat vaguely defined by four places on its borders. But here no less
than thirteen are named. So full are the indications that a fairly exact
map of the diocese could be drawn. Further, in this diocese alone
mention is made of a Cathedral Church: "The Church of Mary in Limerick
is its principal church."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Note the present tense: "The Church of
Mary <i>is</i>"&mdash;not shall be&mdash;"its principal church." We remember that
Gilbert insisted in the <i>De Statu Ecclesiae</i> that a diocese should have
a "pontifical church." Again, the boundaries of this one diocese are
protected by a clause which has no parallel elsewhere: "Whosoever shall
go against these boundaries goes against the Lord, and against Peter the
Apostle, and St. Patrick and his coarb and the Christian Church." Who
but the legate of the Pope would have thus invoked St. Peter?</p>

<p>Surely this portion of the ordinances of the Synod <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>must have been
penned by Gilbert himself. And the whole passage&mdash;by the minuteness of
its description of the diocese, by the strength of the terms in which it
is expressed, by the reference to the Cathedral Church as already
existing&mdash;suggests that the diocese was formed and organized before the
Synod met, as I have already assumed. We may even suspect that an
attempt had been made to invade it, which Gilbert stoutly resisted,
relying on his legatine authority.</p>

<p>In the list of dioceses there is an omission which demands explanation.
No mention whatever is made of Dublin, the oldest diocese in Ireland.
Not only so; the northern limit of the diocese of Glendalough is marked
by Lambay Island and Greenogue, which lies due west of it in the County
Meath. Thus the diocese of Glendalough, as contemplated by the
Synod&mdash;and, it may be added, as it was in fact forty years
later<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>&mdash;included the whole of the actually existing diocese of
Dublin. The Danish Christians of Dublin and their Irish bishop are
treated as interlopers; they are absolutely ignored. It may be said that
this was due to the mutual hostility which divided the diocese of Dublin
from the native Church, and to the fact that the bishops of Dublin had
always been subject to Canterbury. But it is not enough to say this; for
the estrangement of Dublin from the Irish is the very thing that has to
be accounted for.</p>

<p>It had its root in the growing prosperity of the Danish city. The Irish
had no towns. Town life was introduced among them by the Norsemen. And
of their towns Dublin was always the chief. By this time it had become
so important that it had good right to be called <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>the metropolis of the
country. And its citizens were thoroughly aware of this. As early as
1074 the burgesses of Dublin and their bishop, Patrick, claimed for it
that title.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Now in all reason a metropolis should have a
metropolitan as its bishop; and no doubt the bishops of Dublin thought
themselves <i>de facto</i>, if not <i>de jure</i>, superior to the other bishops
of Ireland. In fact we find one of them playing the archbishop. We have
two interesting letters of Anselm, written apparently about 1100. One of
them is addressed to Malchus, bishop of Waterford, directing him to
rebuke Samuel O'Hanley, bishop of Dublin, for various irregularities, in
particular for having his cross carried before him like an archbishop;
the other is addressed to Samuel himself, and complains of the same
actions.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> These proceedings are not likely to have been brought to an
end by Anselm's letters; and we may assume that they were continued as
long as Samuel held the see of Dublin. It was but natural that Cellach
should strongly resent them, for they were disrespectful both to himself
and to the archbishop of Cashel. We are not surprised, therefore, to
find that on the death of Samuel in 1121, eleven years after
Rathbreasail, Cellach tried to get possession of the Church of
Dublin,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> most probably with the intention of bringing it under the
jurisdiction of the bishop of Glendalough. Nor are we surprised that the
men of Dublin at once replied by electing another bishop and bidding
Ralph of Canterbury to consecrate him if he desired to retain the
suffragan see which they had so long preserved for him.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> We shall see
hereafter how the bishops of Dublin were at length induced to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>look with
favour on the Irish Church. Meanwhile we learn that they were not very
obedient suffragans of Canterbury; and we cease to wonder that they were
ignored in the Rathbreasail decrees.</p>

<p>Another feature of the canons of the Synod is worth noting. In several
instances the see of a diocese was not absolutely fixed. Two places were
named, and it was apparently left to the bishop of the future to select
that one of the two which he preferred to be his city. Thus we have a
diocese of Derry or Raphoe, a diocese of Connor or Down, another of
Wexford or Ferns, and so forth. The meaning of this is best seen by
taking a single example. To one of the dioceses of Munster was assigned
the area now occupied by the two dioceses of Waterford and Lismore. It
consisted of the original Danish diocese of Waterford, together with a
much more extensive non-Danish area. Alternative sees were named; it was
described as the parish of Lismore or Waterford. Now Lismore was the
most sacred spot in the enlarged diocese. It was the site of a monastery
founded by St. Mochuta. It was an ideal place for a bishop's see. But it
was doubtless ruled at the moment by an abbot, the coarb of Mochuta.
Unless he was prevailed on to accept episcopal orders, or was deprived
of his authority, a diocesan bishop could not be established there. On
the other hand, Waterford had no sacred traditions; but it was already
the see of a diocese. In default of Lismore it would be a convenient
place for the see. Between Lismore and Waterford the circumstances of
the future must decide. Ultimately, it appears, Malchus retired from the
archbishopric of Cashel, and became bishop of his older diocese, now so
much greater than it had been. He placed his stool, however, not at
Waterford but at Lismore.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> A similar,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>but not always identical
course was followed in other such cases.</p>

<p>What the Synod of Rathbreasail actually accomplished was this. It gave
to Ireland a paper constitution of the approved Roman and Catholic type.
But by doing this it had not achieved the purpose of its existence. In
the years that followed, its enactments had to be carried into effect.
And here was the real crux. Before the Church came to be ruled by
diocesan bishops, the existing rulers&mdash;the coarbs of church
founders&mdash;must be dispossessed of their authority; the numerous bishops
of the old Irish type must be got rid of; the jurisdiction of the new
bishops must be fixed by common consent, or enforced without it; and
revenues must be provided for them. A mere synodal decree could not
accomplish all this. The diocesan system could become a fact throughout
the whole Church, and the last vestiges of the ancient constitution be
made to disappear, only after determined effort, and probably bitter
contention. And when all was done it would certainly be found that the
scheme of dioceses arranged at Rathbreasail had been largely departed
from.</p>

<p>I can best illustrate the nature of the difficulties which had to be
encountered, and the length of time which might be required to overcome
them, by giving a short outline of the history of the forming of the
dioceses of the kingdom of Meath.</p>

<p>In Meath, as we have seen, there were dioceses ruled by bishops before
Rathbreasail. But these dioceses were of small size. It may be doubted
whether most of them fulfilled the condition laid down by Gilbert, that
a bishop should have not less than ten churches within his jurisdiction.
They had therefore to be grouped under a smaller number of prelates.
What had to be accomplished in this case was not so much the clipping of
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>wings of the abbots, as the extirpation of the more recently
appointed diocesan bishops. The Synod determined that the kingdom should
be divided into two dioceses, one in the west, the other in the east.
The western see was to be at Clonard, at the moment, as it seems, the
see of O'Dunan, and famed as the site of the great monastery of St.
Finnian, founded in the sixth century; the eastern see was to be at
Duleek, near Drogheda. Now a few months after the Synod of Rathbreasail
there was held at Usnagh a local synod of the men of Meath, at which the
king and many notable persons were present.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> This synod ordained that
the parishes of Meath should be equally divided between the bishops of
Clonmacnoise and Clonard. It will be observed that the principle of the
Rathbreasail decree was accepted, that there should be two, and only
two, dioceses in Meath. But the change made in the sees is significant.
The Synod of Rathbreasail intended that Clonard should be the see of the
western diocese, which would include Clonmacnoise. The Synod of Usnagh
demanded that Clonmacnoise, founded by one of the most noted of Irish
saints, St. Ciaran, should be one of the surviving sees, and that
Clonard should be the see, not of the western, but of the eastern half
of the kingdom. Thus the Synod of Rathbreasail was at once met with
strenuous and, as it proved, successful opposition in Meath.</p>

<p>And here I may mention another fact. A few years after the Synod we have
proof of the existence of a diocese in the north of the kingdom, which
has not hitherto been mentioned, and which is not named in the
Rathbreasail canons. We know it as the diocese of Kilmore.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> It may
have been one of O'Dunan's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>dioceses, or it may have been founded later.
One thing is certain. The diocese formed the territory of a strong
tribe. Consequently it had in it the element of stability. It was never
suppressed: it exists to this day. So far as it was concerned the canons
of Rathbreasail were a dead letter from the beginning.</p>

<p>But let us return to Clonard. It was the business of its successive
bishops, in accordance with the decrees of Usnagh, to annex the small
neighbouring bishoprics of east Meath. They had considerable success. We
possess a list of churches granted by Eugenius, the last Irish bishop of
Clonard, to the monastery of St. Thomas the Martyr, Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> They are
scattered over the three deaneries of Dunshaughlin, Skreen and Trim.
Thus Eugenius had absorbed into his diocese the bishoprics of those
three places. Another document tells us that this same Eugenius
consecrated the church of Duleek;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> which implies that the diocese of
Duleek was also suppressed. Thus by 1191, the year of Eugenius's
death&mdash;within eighty years of the Synod of Rathbreasail, and before the
Anglo-Normans had captured the ecclesiastical domination of Meath&mdash;the
diocese of Clonard had expanded to four times its original size. Its
bishop ruled the whole area of the modern county of Meath which lies
south of the Boyne and Blackwater.</p>

<p>Simon Rochfort, the first English bishop, stretched his arm further. We
have a charter of his, which may be dated before 1202, confirming to St.
Thomas's Abbey a number of churches in his diocese.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> It includes
most, if not all, of the churches granted by his predecessor, but adds
others. Among these are some in the deanery of Slane. The bishopric of
Slane had been absorbed.</p>

<p>The rapid extension of his diocese towards the north <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>suggested to
Rochfort the desirability of having for his headquarters a more central
place than Clonard. So in 1202 he translated the see to Newtown, near
Trim,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> and began to call himself Bishop of Meath. Ten years later, as
we know, this "impudent bishop" captured the diocese of Kells.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> The
bishop of Meath (no longer of Clonard) from his see at Newtown had the
oversight of nearly the whole of the modern county. Within the confines
of his diocese were the seven older dioceses of Clonard, Dunshaughlin,
Skreen, Trim, Duleek, Slane and Kells. This was probably the whole of
the eastern diocese as designed by the Synod of Usnagh.</p>

<p>But the policy of annexation still went forward apace. Another document
enables us to measure the progress of half a century. It is a concordat
concerning metropolitical visitations, between the archbishop of Armagh
and Rochfort's third successor, Hugh de Tachmon. It is dated 9th April,
1265.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> The tenor of the concordat does not concern us: it is
important for our purpose because it proves that in 1265 there were
eleven rural deaneries in the diocese of Meath. Four more petty dioceses
had been suppressed, Mullingar, Loxewdy, Ardnurcher and Fore. The
diocese was co-extensive with that of the present day, except that the
diocese of Clonmacnoise&mdash;as small in 1265 as it had been in 1100&mdash;was
not yet brought in.</p>

<p>Clonmacnoise preserved its independence three centuries longer. It was
incorporated with Meath in 1569. Thus at length the dream of the fathers
of Rathbreasail was fulfilled. There were two dioceses in the ancient
kingdom of Meath&mdash;Meath and Kilmore. But neither <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>Duleek nor Clonard nor
Clonmacnoise was a see. From that day to this, in fact, the diocese of
Meath has had no see. And the boundary which parts Meath from Kilmore is
very different from the line which the fathers of Rathbreasail drew
between the dioceses of Clonard and Duleek, or that which the assembly
of Usnagh drew between Clonmacnoise and Clonard.</p>


<p class="subhead2"><span class="smcap">IV.&mdash;St. Malachy's Part in The Reformation</span></p>

<p>It is not possible, within the limits of this Introduction, to follow
the later stages of the Reformation movement in detail. In the present
section I confine myself to the part which St. Malachy played in its
development.</p>

<p>Malachy was born at Armagh in 1095. He was therefore a mere boy when the
Synod of Rathbreasail met. At the dawn of his manhood he became the
disciple of the recluse Imar O'Hagan. Imar was in sympathy with the aims
of the reformers, and it was probably through his influence that Malachy
became imbued with their principles. He soon attracted the notice of
Cellach, and was by him ordained deacon. He was advanced to the
priesthood about 1119. Shortly afterwards Cellach made the young priest
his vicar. For the next year or two it was Malachy's duty to administer
the diocese of Armagh; and he did so in the most effective&mdash;indeed
revolutionary&mdash;fashion. He evidently let no man despise his youth. His
purpose, as his biographer tells us, was "to root out barbarous rites,
to plant the rites of the Church." "He established in all the churches
the apostolic sanctions and the decrees of the holy fathers, and
especially the customs of the Holy Roman Church." He introduced the
Roman method of chanting the services of the canonical hours. "He
instituted anew Confession, Confirmation, the Marriage contract, of all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>of which those over whom he was placed were either ignorant or
negligent." In a word, Malachy showed himself an ardent reformer.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>One wonders how, even with the assistance of Cellach and Imar, a young
man who had never left Armagh could have already become sufficiently
acquainted with the usages of other churches to carry out these sweeping
measures. Perhaps his zeal was not always according to knowledge. But he
soon became aware of his limitations, and determined to seek
instruction. With the consent of Cellach and Imar he betook himself to
Malchus, who had by this time retired from the archbishopric of Cashel
and was settled at Lismore. There Malachy spent three years. During that
period he doubtless increased his knowledge of Roman customs and
principles. But he did more. Cormac MacCarthy, son of the king of
Desmond, was then a refugee in the monastery of Malchus. Between Cormac
and Malachy there grew up a friendship, which proved in later years of
much advantage to the reforming cause.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>But at length Malachy's presence was urgently needed in the north, and
he was recalled by Cellach and Imar. What had happened was this. The
coarb of St. Comgall at Bangor, the principal religious site in the
north-east of Ireland, had lately died. Since he ended his days at
Lismore, it may be assumed that he was a friend of Malchus, and of the
movement with which he was identified. At any rate his successor, who
was Malachy's uncle, expressed his willingness to surrender his office
and the site of the monastery to his nephew.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Here was an opportunity
to carry into effect one of the canons of Rathbreasail, which had
hitherto <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>been a dead letter, by establishing the diocese of Connor.
Cellach, duly elected coarb of Patrick, and consecrated bishop, had no
doubt been able to organize the diocese of Armagh in accordance with the
Rathbreasail scheme. In like manner such a man as Malachy, enjoying the
prestige which belonged to the coarb of Comgall, if consecrated bishop,
would probably succeed in organizing the diocese of Connor. So in 1124
Malachy journeyed to Bangor, was installed as abbot, and was made bishop
by Cellach.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> He administered his diocese with the same vigour which
had already characterized his work at Armagh. But it is interesting to
observe how closely he conformed to the old Irish type of bishop, in
spite of his Roman proclivities. At heart he was far less bishop of
Connor than coarb of Comgall, abbot of Bangor. Indeed, in strictness, he
had no right to the title "bishop of Connor"; for Connor was not his
see. He made Bangor his headquarters.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Doubtless Malachy preferred
Bangor to the nominal see, because it was consecrated by centuries of
sacred memories, and because as yet he could not place the office of
bishop above that of abbot. He ruled his great newly formed diocese, or
as much of it as he succeeded in ruling, from its remotest corner on the
sea shore, as Aidan ruled Northumbria from Holy Island. There he lived
among his brethren, of whom he gathered a great company. There was no
provision for his mensa, for he was "a lover of poverty." He practised
austere asceticism. Yet he was an active missionary. He travelled
incessantly through the diocese, but always on foot, visiting the towns,
and roaming about the country parts, surrounded by his disciples. He
preached to the people whom he met on his way.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Nothing could be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>more unlike a medieval bishop of the ordinary kind. At every point we
are reminded of the labours of Aidan and Ceadd and Cedd as they are
described by Bede. But we may be sure that it was precisely because
Malachy was coarb of Bangor, because he lived according to the ancient
Irish ideal of sainthood, that he secured the obedience of the people of
his diocese.</p>

<p>In such work as I have mentioned Malachy was engaged from 1124 to 1127.
In the latter year he was driven out of Bangor by Conor O'Loughlin, king
of the north of Ireland, and a second time betook himself to Lismore.
There he again met Cormac MacCarthy, for that unfortunate prince was
once more taking sanctuary with Malchus. He had succeeded a little while
before to the throne of Desmond, but had been driven out by Turlough
O'Conor, who made his brother king in his stead. But after a few months,
persuaded by the entreaties of Malchus and Malachy, and aided by the
arms of Conor O'Brien, king of Thomond, a nephew of Murtough, Anselm's
correspondent, he made a successful attempt to regain his kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
Then Malachy moved on to Iveragh in the County Kerry, and there, under
Cormac's patronage, he founded a new monastery for his community.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
Once again Cormac has friendly intercourse with Malachy, and another
O'Brien is on good terms with the reformers.</p>

<p>It was at Iveragh, two years later, that Malachy received news of the
death of Archbishop Cellach.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> It was an announcement which must have
caused great anxiety to him and his friends. Who was to succeed to the
primacy?</p>

<p>The importance of the question will become manifest if we recall the
progress which had already been made <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>at Armagh, and what still remained
to be done. When Cellach was elected abbot in 1105, and in the following
year was consecrated bishop, a great point had been gained. For the
first time for 150 years the church of Armagh had a bishop as its ruler.
We may suppose that Cellach soon organized the diocese, the limits of
which were fixed at Rathbreasail. But whatever Gilbert or Malchus might
hold as to the source of his authority, we cannot imagine that the
members of the Church in the diocese based their allegiance to him on
any other ground than the fact that he was their abbot and the coarb of
Patrick. That he was a bishop added nothing, in their view, to his
claims. Moreover Cellach belonged to the family which had long supplied
Armagh with abbots. The abuse of hereditary succession had not
disappeared with his appointment.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> If his successor was chosen in the
time-honoured way, a member of the coarbial family would certainly be
selected, and in all probability he would be a layman, who would not
accept episcopal orders. In a word, all that had been achieved by the
reformers at the most important ecclesiastical centre in Ireland would
be undone.</p>

<p>Cellach had foreseen this, and accordingly he determined to nominate
Malachy as his successor. "With the authority of Patrick" he laid upon
the nobles, and especially upon "the two kings of Munster," the
obligation of securing that his wish should be carried into effect. The
two kings who were thus charged with a difficult duty were Conor
O'Brien, king of Thomond, the principal representative of the O'Briens,
and Cormac MacCarthy, king of Desmond, Malachy's friend.</p>

<p>From Cellach's point of view the choice of a successor which he had made
was a wise one. Malachy was as zealous a reformer as himself. He was a
man of unusual <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>ability and force of character. Besides, he was
possessed of a personal charm which might in time disarm opposition. He
was already a bishop; therefore, if he were once seated in the chair of
Patrick, the question whether the new coarb should be consecrated would
not arise. More important still, he was not of the coarbial stock; with
his entry into the see the scandal of hereditary succession would come
to an end.</p>

<p>But it was not to be expected that the appointment would be accepted
without strong protest; and at the moment there seemed little prospect
that the scheme of Cellach would attain fruition. There is no need to
enter into the details of the fierce struggle that ensued. It is dealt
with elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Suffice it to say that by 1137, with the aid of
O'Brien and MacCarthy, and apparently with assistance also from Donough
O'Carroll, king of Oriel, he was undisputed coarb of Patrick and
archbishop of Armagh. The victory was won, and an immense stride had
been made in the Reformation movement.</p>

<p>But Malachy had no mind to spend the rest of his life at Armagh. Five
years before, as the condition of his entry into the fray, he had
stipulated that as soon as he had been accepted as archbishop he should
resign the see and return to his beloved Bangor. So in 1137 he nominated
and consecrated Gelasius as his successor in the primacy, and "returned
to his former parish, but not to Connor." Let me explain this
enigmatical statement. Malachy had had some years' experience of the
people of the diocese of Connor, whom St. Bernard gently describes as
"not men but beasts." He had doubtless discovered that the district
which it included could not be ruled by a single bishop. In fact it
consisted of two tribal territories, D&aacute;l Araide in the north, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>and Ulaid
in the south; and the two tribes which inhabited them were usually
engaged in mutual war. He decided that it should be divided into two
dioceses. He consecrated a bishop for D&aacute;l Araide, with his see at
Connor, and himself resumed the oversight of Ulaid, with his see at
Bangor.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Thus originated the present dioceses of Down and Connor. In
Malachy's time the boundary between them seems to have run west from
Larne. In the course of centuries it has shifted further south.</p>

<p>This division was a direct violation of the letter of the ordinance of
Rathbreasail; but it did not contravene its spirit. In the letter, which
ignored the civil divisions of the country, the ordinance could not be
obeyed. Malachy adopted a scheme which secured the permanent rule of
diocesan bishops in the district.</p>

<p>Malachy was now, and continued to be till his death, bishop of Down, or
more strictly of Bangor; in the current Irish phrase bishop of Ulaid.
But his activities already extended beyond his diocese. Within the next
two years he succeeded in establishing in actual fact another diocese
which till now had existed only on paper. It was that which the Synod of
Rathbreasail had called the diocese of Clogher, and which we know by the
same name; but which for sixty years or more bore the name of the
diocese of Oriel.</p>

<p>That we may understand his action let us return for a moment to the five
Ulster dioceses as planned at Rathbreasail. In four of them regard was
paid to tribal boundaries. The diocese of Raphoe corresponded to T&iacute;r
Conaill, Derry to T&iacute;r Eoghain, Armagh to Oriel, while Connor
comprehended the two territories of D&aacute;l Araide and Ulaid. The diocese of
Clogher was of necessity the remainder of the province. If it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>coincided
with a tribal district, that could only happen by chance. In fact it did
not. It was much smaller than the other dioceses. It embraced only the
present barony of Clogher in the county of Tyrone, and the portion of
Fermanagh lying between it and the Erne waterway. It had within it no
element of cohesion. It was most unlikely that it could ever constitute
an ecclesiastical unit, governed by a bishop.</p>

<p>Nevertheless an attempt seems to have been made to consolidate it as a
diocese a few years after Rathbreasail; as might have been expected,
without success. A bishop of Clogher, who apparently had no diocese,
died in 1135. He was succeeded by Christian O'Morgair, brother of
Malachy. He was probably nominated and consecrated by his brother, who
was then titular archbishop of Armagh. Now about this time Donough
O'Carroll, king of Oriel, joined the ranks of the reformers, as we may
suppose under the influence of Malachy. His kingdom included the little
diocese of Clogher; but the main part of it consisted of the present
counties of Monaghan and Louth. Accordingly a bold stroke of policy was
conceived and carried out. The diocese of Clogher was enlarged so as to
cover the greater part of O'Carroll's kingdom. For this purpose the
archbishop of Armagh surrendered a large part of his diocese&mdash;the whole
of Monaghan and Louth. Then Christian moved his see from Clogher to the
spot now occupied by the village of Louth. Thus there was constituted a
new diocese, which included the Rathbreasail diocese of Clogher, but was
four times its size, and had its see at Louth. It was known as the
diocese of Oriel. In all this we see plainly the hand of Malachy. Not
long after the removal of the see Christian died, and Malachy selected
and consecrated his successor, one Edan O'Kelly. O'Kelly had a long
episcopate, from 1139 to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>1182; and with the help of O'Carroll he
organized his diocese, and gave it a cathedral at Louth with a chapter
of Augustinian canons.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> Once again Malachy was the maker of a
diocese; and once again, in the interest of stability, he transgressed
the letter of the Rathbreasail canons, while fulfilling their spirit. It
was not till after the coming of the Anglo-Normans that the see was
brought back to Clogher. Subsequently the county of Louth reverted to
Armagh, and the diocese extended to the west. About the year 1250 its
boundaries came to be what they now are.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>In 1139, after settling the affairs of the diocese of Oriel, Malachy
left Ireland on an important mission. It will be remembered that Gilbert
had declared that no archbishop could exercise his functions till the
Pope had sent him the pall. That was the current doctrine of the age.
Now neither Cellach, nor Malachy, nor Gelasius, nor Malchus, nor his
successor at Cashel, had received that ornament. They had therefore, in
the strict sense, no right to the title of archbishop. Malachy resolved
to make request to the Pope in person for palls for the two Irish
metropolitans. So he set out from Bangor for Rome.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> Of his journey it
is unnecessary to say anything here.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>At Rome Malachy was received by Pope Innocent II. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>with great honour. He
confirmed the erection of the metropolitan see of Cashel. But he
politely declined to grant the palls. They must be demanded, he said, by
a council of the bishops, clergy and magnates; and then they would be
given.</p>

<p>But if the Pope refused Malachy's request, he bestowed on him an office,
the securing of which we may conjecture to have been one of the purposes
of his visit to Rome, though St. Bernard does not say so. Gilbert, now
old and infirm, had resigned the see of Limerick, and with it his
legatine commission. Innocent made Malachy papal legate in his
stead.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>Thus Malachy returned to Ireland, still bishop of Down indeed, but
virtually chief prelate of the Irish Church. For the following eight
years he laboured with zeal and vigour. St. Bernard unfortunately gives
little information concerning the details of his administrative work as
legate. But he relates one incident which suggests that in this period
Malachy was instrumental in founding another diocese. He nominated and
consecrated the first known bishop of Cork,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> not improbably with the
intention that he should unite in his own person the two offices of
coarb of Barre, founder of Cork, and diocesan bishop.</p>

<p>And in this connexion it is worth noticing that he was evidently on
friendly terms with Nehemiah, the first known bishop of the neighbouring
diocese of Cloyne.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> If that diocese was also founded by him he once
again violated the letter of the Rathbreasail canons, for by them Cloyne
was included in the diocese of Emly.</p>

<p>In 1148 Malachy convened a synod at Inispatrick, an island opposite
Skerries, Co. Dublin. This synod demanded the palls in due form, and
sent Malachy to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span>obtain them. But he got no further on his journey than
Clairvaux. There, after celebrating Mass on St. Luke's Day, he was taken
ill of a fever; and there a fortnight later he died in the arms of St.
Bernard, on All Souls' Day, 2nd November, 1148.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless the palls came. They were brought to Ireland by a legate
specially commissioned by Pope Eugenius III., John Paparo, cardinal
priest of St. Laurence. A synod was held at Kells to receive them in
March 1152,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> of which the joint presidents were Paparo, as <i>legatus a
latere</i>, and Christian, first abbot of Mellifont, and now bishop of
Lismore, who had lately succeeded Malachy as <i>legatus natus</i>.</p>

<p>Of this synod Keating gives a short account, abridged from the <i>Annals
of Clonenagh</i>,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> from which he had also derived his knowledge of the
proceedings at Rathbreasail. He preserves a list of the bishops who
attended. It includes twenty-two names, if we count two vicars who
represented absent bishops. There were besides, as Keating informs us,
five bishops-elect. And there was certainly one bishop of a diocese who
was neither present nor represented, Edan O'Kelly, bishop of Oriel. So
it appears that in 1152 there were at least twenty-eight dioceses in
Ireland&mdash;a number considerably larger than was contemplated at
Rathbreasail. The increase in number is partly accounted for by the
presence of the bishop of the recently formed diocese of Kilmore, the
division of the diocese of Connor into Connor and Down, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>and, a most
striking addition, the inclusion of Gregory, bishop of Dublin, among the
assembled prelates. It is remarkable that the bishop of Kells is not
mentioned, though the synod was held in his own city. How was the bishop
of Dublin induced to throw in his lot with the Irish Church? We shall
see in a moment.</p>

<p>Much business was transacted at this Synod. But that which concerns us
most nearly is the giving of the palls. Cardinal Paparo brought the
Irish bishops more than they had asked for; more indeed than they
desired. He presented, not two palls but four, Dublin and Tuam, as well
as Armagh and Cashel, being recognized as archiepiscopal sees. This
excessive generosity caused much displeasure among the Irish bishops.
"For Ireland," says Keating, apparently paraphrasing the <i>Annals of
Clonenagh</i>, "thought it enough to have a pall in the church of Armagh
and a pall in Cashel; and particularly it was in spite of the church of
Armagh and the church of Down that the other palls were given." The
cause of this discontent is not far to seek. The chief gravamen no doubt
was that Dublin was included among the four. The constant friction which
had subsisted for many years between the diocese of Dublin and the Irish
Church sufficiently explains the indignation of the archbishop of
Armagh, aggravated by the fact that the creation of new archbishops
imposed a limit upon his authority. It also enables us to understand why
his displeasure was shared by the Irish generally. That a see whose
bishops had behaved so haughtily in the past should, at the very moment
of its entrance into the Irish Church, receive so signal an honour, long
denied to Armagh and Cashel, and that in the person of its bishop it
should be given jurisdiction over bishops whom till now it had treated
with contempt, could not but be regarded as unreasonable, or even
insulting. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span>But on the other hand, recalling the early history of the
Church in Dublin, we can comprehend why, in spite of all this, special
favour was bestowed upon it. Dublin, as we have seen, was a not too
submissive suffragan of Canterbury. Its ambition was that its bishop
should have the status of a metropolitan. The opportunity had come for
gratifying its desire, and at the same time bringing it under the Irish
ecclesiastical r&eacute;gime. The pall at once separated it from Canterbury and
united it with Ireland. It was the price paid for its submission to the
Primacy of Armagh. Gregory therefore became archbishop of Dublin, and
had the right&mdash;which his predecessor had long before illegally
assumed&mdash;to have the cross carried before him. With the gift of the pall
Paparo bestowed upon him "the principal part of the bishopric of
Glendalough as his diocese," promising him the remainder on the death of
the bishop who then ruled it. All this was done, we are told, because it
was fitting that the place "in which from ancient time had been the
royal seat and head of Ireland," should be made a metropolitan see.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>There was at last one Church in Ireland, which embraced within it not
only the Celtic parts of the island, but all the Danish dioceses as
well. And the whole Church was ruled by the bishops. The Reformation may
not have been complete in every detail&mdash;there was indeed much left for
the Anglo-Normans to do&mdash;but the Synod of Kells had set the crown on the
work of the Irish reformers. And this consummation was mainly due to the
wisdom and the untiring zeal of St. Malachy of Armagh.</p>

<p>A few words more will suffice to complete this too <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>lengthy
introduction. The <i>Life of Malachy</i> was certainly written before the
Synod of Kells met in March 1152; for Christian, who attended the Synod
as bishop of Lismore, is spoken of in the <i>Life</i> as abbot of
Mellifont.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> Its earliest possible date is a couple of months after

passage that Limerick was at that time a suffragan see of Canterbury.
But this seems impossible in view of Gilbert's share in the proceedings
of the Synod of Rathbreasail five years earlier. Eadmer is not a very
good witness in such matters, and his language is hardly decisive for
two reasons. (1) It is not clear that he includes Gilbert among the
suffragans who co-operated in the consecration: "Huic consecrationi
interfuerunt et cooperatores extiterunt suffraganei ecclesiae
Cantuariensis, episcopi videlicet hi, Willelmus Wintoniensis, Robertus
Lincoliensis, Rogerus Serberiensis, Johannes Bathoniensis, Urbanus
Glamorgatensis, Gislebertus Lumniensis de Hibernia." (2) The word
"suffragan" is often used as meaning merely an assistant bishop. Thus in
the fifteenth century several bishops of Dromore were "suffragans" of
the archbishop of York; but Dromore was certainly not regarded as one of
his suffragan sees.</p></div>

quotes it the ordinance applies to the whole of Ireland. But we have no
evidence of the transformation of dioceses into deaneries outside Meath;
and it is quite probable that a synod held in Meath would have in view,
in such a decree, only the conditions which prevailed in that district.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> The cogency of this argument is enhanced when we observe
that there is strong independent evidence for the existence in the
twelfth century of one of the six dioceses&mdash;the diocese of Kells. (<i>a</i>)
Up to the latter part of the sixteenth century (1583) there was an
archdeacon of Kells, as well as an archdeacon of Meath; the jurisdiction
of an archdeacon (at any rate in Ireland) seems to have been always
originally co-extensive with a diocese. The first known archdeacon of
Kells was Adam Petit who was in office in 1230 (<i>R.T.A.</i> 279; <i>C.M.A.</i>
i. 101); but it is unlikely that he had no predecessors. (<i>b</i>) Among the
prelates who greeted Henry II. at Dublin in 1171 was Thaddaeus, bishop
of Kells (Benedict of Peterborough (R. S.), i. 26). (<i>c</i>) In the time of
Innocent III. (1198-1216) the question was raised in the papal curia
whether the bishop of Kells was subject to the archbishop of Armagh or
the archbishop of Tuam (Theiner, p. 2). (<i>d</i>) The bishop of Kells is
mentioned in a document of the year 1202 (<i>Cal. of Docts. Ireland</i>, i.
168). (<i>e</i>) A contemporary note records the suppression of the
bishopric: "When a Cistercian monk ... had been elected and consecrated
bishop of Kells by the common consent of the clergy and people, and had
been confirmed by the Pope, the impudent bishop of Meath cast him out
with violence and dared to [add] his bishopric to his own" (<i>C.M.A.</i> ii.
22). This statement implies that the dispossessed bishop ruled over a
diocese. Moreover, when we remember that the see was certainly
suppressed before Rochfort's Synod of 1216, that Rochfort was the first
person who assumed the title "bishop of Meath" in the modern sense, and
that a bishop of Kells died in 1211 (<i>A.L.C.</i>), we need not hesitate to
conclude that the "impudent bishop" was Rochfort himself, and that the
suppression was accomplished about 1213.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> <i>I.e.</i> dioceses. This synod is mentioned in <i>A.T.</i>, <i>A.I.</i>
and the <i>Annals of Boyle</i>. Particulars of its Acts and of the persons
present at it are given in <i>C.S.</i> and <i>D.A.I.</i> <i>C.S.</i> has "parish" in
the singular. But this does not seem to yield good sense; for the whole
extent of the kingdom of Meath could scarcely have been called a
"parish" in the twelfth century. I therefore read "parishes." The
singular may have been substituted for the plural at a later time, when
the kingdom (or the greater part of it) included only the dioceses of
Meath and Clonmacnoise, and their earlier history was forgotten. Cp. the
unhistorical statement of St. Bernard about Down and Connor in <i>Life</i>, &sect;
31. <i>D.A.I.</i> have an anomalous form (<i>faircheadh</i>), which may have come
from either the singular (<i>fairche</i>) or the plural (<i>faircheadha</i>) in
the exemplar, but more probably from the latter.</p></div>

sending the palls. After the death of Malachy a deputation was sent from
Ireland to Rome to demand them. Paparo set out to confer them, and
reached England in 1150; but King Stephen would not allow him to proceed
to Ireland except on terms which he could not accept. (John of Hexham,

erroneous statement (<i>ibid.</i>) that Pope Eugenius went <i>to Rome</i> in the

<p>1. It is indeed always worth while to portray the illustrious lives of
the saints, that they may serve as a mirror and an example, and give, as
it were, a relish to the life of men on earth. For by this means in some
sort they <i>live</i> among us, even <i>after death</i>,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> and many of those
who <i>are dead while they live</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> are challenged and recalled by them
to true life. But now especially is there need for it because holiness
is rare, and it is plain that our age is lacking in men. So greatly, in
truth, do we perceive that lack to have increased in our day that none
can doubt that we are smitten by that saying, <i>Because iniquity shall
abound the love of many shall wax cold</i>;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> and, as I suppose, he has
come or is at hand of whom it is written, <i>Want shall go before his
face</i>.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> If I mistake not, Antichrist is he whom famine and sterility
of all good both precedes and accompanies. Whether therefore it is the
herald of one now present or the harbinger of one who shall come
immediately, the <i>want</i> is evident. I speak not of the crowd, I speak
not of the vile multitude of <i>the children of this world</i>:<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> I would
have you lift up your eyes upon the very <i>pillars</i><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> of the Church.
Whom can you show me, even of the number of those who <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>seem to be <i>given
for a light to the Gentiles</i>,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> that in his lofty station is not
rather a smoking wick than a blazing lamp? And, says One, <i>if the light
that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness</i>!<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Unless
perchance, which I do not believe, you will say that they shine who
<i>suppose that gain is godliness</i>;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> who in the Lord's inheritance
<i>seek not the things which are</i> the Lord's, but rather <i>their own</i>.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
Why do I say <i>their own</i>? He would be perfect and holy, even while he
seeks his own and retains his own, who should restrain his heart and
hands from the things of others. But let him remember, who seems to
himself to have advanced perhaps thus far, that the same degree of
holiness is demanded even of a gentile.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> Are not <i>soldiers</i> bidden
to <i>be content with their wages</i> that they may be saved?<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> But it is
a great thing for a doctor of the Church if he be as one of the
soldiers; or, <i>if</i>, in truth (as the prophet speaks to their reproach),
<i>it be as with the people so with the priest</i>.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Hideous! Is it so
indeed? Is he rightly to be esteemed highest who, falling from the
highest rank can scarce cleave to the lowest, that he be not engulfed in
the abyss? Yet how rare is even such a man among the clergy! Whom,
likewise, do you give me who is content with necessaries, who despises
superfluities? Yet the law has been enjoined beforehand by the Apostles
on the successors of the Apostles, <i>Having</i> food <i>and</i> raiment, <i>let us
be therewith content</i>.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> Where is this rule? We see it in books, but
not in men. But you have [the saying] about the righteous man, that <i>the
law of his God is in his heart</i>,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> not in a codex. Nor is that the
standard of perfection. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>The perfect man is ready to forgo even
necessaries. But that is beside the mark.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Would that some limit
were set on superfluous things! Would that our desires were not
infinite! But what? Perhaps you might find one who can achieve this. It
would indeed be difficult; but [if we find him] see what we have done.
We were seeking for a very good man, a deliverer of many; and lo, we
have labour to discover one who can save himself. The very good man
to-day is one who is not utterly bad.</p>

<p>2. Wherefore, <i>since the godly man has ceased</i><a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> from the earth, it
seems to me that I do not employ myself to no purpose when I recall to
our midst, from among those <i>who were redeemed from the earth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
Bishop Malachy, a man truly holy, and a man, too, of our own time, of
singular wisdom and virtue. <i>He was a burning and a shining light</i>;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
and it has not been quenched, but only removed. Who would with good
right be angry with me if I move it back again? Yes indeed, neither the
men of my own age, nor any succeeding generation should be wanting in
gratitude to me if by my pen I recall one whom the course of nature has
borne away; if I restore to the world one <i>of whom the world was not
worthy</i>;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> if I preserve for the memory of men one <i>whose memory may
be blessed</i><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> to all who shall deign to read; if while I rouse my
sleeping friend, <i>the voice of the turtle be heard in our land</i><a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
saying, <i>Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world</i>.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>
Then again, he was buried among <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>us;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> this duty is eminently ours.
Nay, is it not mine, inasmuch as that holy man included me among his
special friends, and in such regard that I may believe that I was second
to none <i>in that respect of glory</i>?<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Nor do I find that intercourse
with holiness so eminent misses its reward; I have already received the
first-fruits. He was near the end; nay, rather, near the beginning,
according to the saying, <i>when a man hath finished then is he but at the
beginning</i>.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> I ran to him that <i>the blessing of him that was ready
to</i> die might <i>come upon me</i>.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Already he could not move his other
limbs; but, mighty to give blessing, he raised his hands upon my head
and blessed me.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> I have <i>inherited the blessing</i>;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> how then can
I be silent about him? Finally, you enjoin me to undertake this task,
Abbot Congan,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> my reverend brother and sweet friend, and with you
also (as you write from Ireland) <i>all</i> that <i>Church of the saints</i><a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>
to which you belong.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> I obey with a will, the more so because you
ask <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>not panegyric but narrative. I shall endeavour that it may be
chaste and clear, informing the devout, and not wearying the fastidious.
At any rate the truth of my narrative is assured, since it has been
communicated by you;<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> and beyond doubt you assert nothing but things
of which you have most certain information.</p>

the Cistercian Order, as the words "reverend brother" imply. He may
therefore be identified with Congan, abbot of the Cistercian monastery
of the Suir, mentioned in &sect; 64. That he was personally known to St.
Bernard is clear; and it is probable that he was one of the Irishmen who
by Malachy's desire were instructed at Clairvaux (&sect; 39). Thady Dowling
(<i>Annals</i>, <i>s.a.</i> 1147) identifies him with "Cogganus," abbot of
Killeshin, near Carlow, stating on the authority of Nicholas Maguire
that he wrote the <i>gesta</i> of Malachy and Bernard. Though this statement
is probably not accurate, it is possible that our Congan was abbot of
Killeshin before he became a Cistercian.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1095.</div>

<p>1. Our Malachy, born in Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> of a barbarous people, was brought
up there, and there received his education. But from the barbarism of
his birth he contracted no taint, any more than the fishes of the sea
from their native salt. But how delightful to reflect, that uncultured
barbarism should have produced for us so worthy<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> <i>a fellow-citizen
with the saints and member of the household of God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> He who brings
<i>honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock</i><a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Himself did
this. His parents,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> however, were great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>both by descent and in
power, <i>like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>
Moreover his mother,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> more noble in mind than in blood, took pains,
<i>in the very beginning of his ways</i>,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> <i>to show</i> to her child <i>the
ways of life</i>,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> esteeming this knowledge of more value to him than
the empty knowledge of the learning of this world. For both, however, he
had aptitude in proportion to his age. In the schools <i>he was taught</i>
learning, at home <i>the fear of the Lord</i>,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> and by daily progress he
duly responded to both teacher and mother.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> For indeed he was
endowed from the first with a <i>good spirit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> in virtue of which he
was a docile boy and very lovable, wonderfully gracious to all in all
things. But he was [now] drinking, instead of milk from the breast of a
mother, <i>the waters of saving wisdom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> and day by day he was
increasing in discretion. In discretion, shall I say, or in holiness? If
I say both, I shall not regret it, <i>for I should say the truth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> He
behaved as an old man, a boy in years without a boy's playfulness. And
when because of this he was regarded with reverence and astonishment by
all, he was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>not found on that account, as commonly happens, more
arrogant, but rather quiet and subdued in <i>all meekness</i>.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> Not
impatient of rule, not shunning discipline, not averse from reading,
not, therefore, eager for games&mdash;so especially dear to the heart of boys
of that age. <i>And he advanced beyond all of his own age</i><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> in that
learning, at least, which suited his years. For in discipline of morals
and advance in virtues in a short time he even outshone <i>all his
instructors</i>.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> His <i>unction</i>,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> however, rather than his mother,
was his teacher. Urged by it he exercised himself not slothfully also in
divine things, to seek solitude, <i>to anticipate vigils</i>,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> to
<i>meditate in the law</i>,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> to eat sparingly, to pray frequently, and
(because on account of his studies he had not leisure to frequent the
church, and from modesty would not) to <i>lift up holy hands
everywhere</i><a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> to heaven; but only where it could be done
secretly&mdash;for already he was careful to avoid vainglory, that poison of
virtues.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>2. There is a hamlet near the city in which the boy studied,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
whither his teacher was wont to go often, accompanied by him alone. When
they were going there both together, as he related afterwards, he would
<i>step back, stop a moment</i>,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> and standing behind his teacher, when
he was not aware of it, <i>spread forth his hands toward heaven</i>,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> and
quickly send forth a prayer, as if it were a dart; and, thus
dissembling, once more would follow the teacher. By such a pious trick
the boy often deceived him who was his companion as well as teacher. It
is not possible to mention all the qualities which adorned his earlier
years with the hue of a good natural disposition; we must hasten to
greater and more useful <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>matters. One further incident, however, I
relate because, in my judgement, it yielded a sign, not only of good,
but also of great hope in the boy. Roused once on a time by the
reputation of a certain teacher, famous in the studies which are called
liberal, he went to him desiring to learn. For indeed he was now
grasping after the last opportunities of boyhood, and was longing
eagerly for such learning. But when he went into the house he saw the
man playing with an awl, and with rapid strokes making furrows in the
wall in some strange fashion. And shocked at the bare sight, because it
smacked of levity, the serious boy dashed away from him, and did not
care even to see him from that time forward. Thus, though an avid
student of letters, as a lover of virtue he esteemed them lightly in
comparison with that which was becoming. By such preliminary exercises
the boy was being prepared for the conflict which awaited him in more
advanced<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> age; and already in his own person he was challenging the
adversary. Such, then, was the boyhood of Malachy. Moreover he passed
through his adolescence with like simplicity and purity; except that as
<i>years</i> increased, there <i>increased</i> also for him <i>wisdom and favour
with God and man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>3. From this time, that is, from his early adolescence, <i>what was in the
man</i><a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> began to appear more plainly, and it came to be seen that <i>the
grace of God which was in him was not in vain</i>.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> For the
<i>industrious young man</i>,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> seeing how <i>the world lieth in
wickedness</i>,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and considering what sort of spirit <i>he had received</i>,
said within himself, "It is <i>not the spirit of this world</i>.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> What
have the two in common?<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> One has no <i>communion</i> with the other any
more than <i>light with darkness</i>.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> But my spirit

know the things that are freely given me</i><a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> in it. From it I have
innocence of life till now, from it the ornament of continence, from it
hunger for <i>righteousness</i>,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> from it also that <i>glory of mine</i>, by
so much more secure because it is more secret, <i>the testimony of my
conscience</i>.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> None of these is safe for me under <i>the prince of this
world</i>.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> Then, <i>I have this treasure in an earthen vessel</i>.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> I

it is most difficult not to strike <i>against something amid</i> the stones
and rocks <i>of this</i> crooked and winding <i>way and life</i>.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> Must I thus
in a moment lose together all <i>the blessings of goodness with which</i> I

And what I am and all that I have, where can they be as safe as in the
hand of their Author? Who so concerned to preserve, so powerful to hold,
so faithful to restore? He will preserve in safety. He will restore in
good time. Without hesitation I give myself to serve Him by His gifts. I
cannot lose aught of all that I spend on my labour of piety. Perchance I
may even hope for some greater boon. He who gives freely is wont to
repay with usury. So it is. He will even heap up and <i>increase virtue in
my soul</i>."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>4. (3) There was a man in the city of Armagh,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> where Malachy was
brought up&mdash;a holy man and of great austerity of life, a pitiless
<i>castigator of his body</i>,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> who had a cell near the church.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> In
it he abode, <i>serving God with fastings and prayers day and night</i>.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>
To this man Malachy betook himself to receive a rule<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> of life from
him, who had condemned himself while alive to such sepulture. And note
his humility. From his earliest age he had had God as his teacher&mdash;there
is no doubt of it&mdash;in the art of holiness; and behold, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>he became once
more the disciple of a man, himself a man <i>meek and lowly in
heart</i>.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> If we did not know it, by this one deed he himself gave us

carefully and wisely. By what better method, I ask, could he both give
and receive a proof of his progress? If the example of Malachy <i>is</i> for
them <i>a very small thing</i>,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> let them consider the action of Paul.
Did not he judge that his <i>Gospel</i>, though he had <i>not received it of
man but</i> from <i>Christ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> <i>should be discussed</i> with men, <i>lest by

heed lest it be not so much confidence as rashness. But these matters
belong to another time.</p>

<p>5. Now, however, the rumour of what had happened went through the city,
and it was universally stirred by this new and unexpected event. All
were amazed, and wondered at his virtue, all the more because it was
unusual in a rude people. You would see that then <i>thoughts were being
revealed out of the hearts of many</i>.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> The majority, considering the
act from a human standpoint, were lamenting and grieving that a youth
who was an object of love and delight to all had given himself up to
such severe labours. Others, suspecting lightness on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>account of his
age, doubted whether he would persevere, and feared a fall. Some,
accusing him of rashness, were in fact highly indignant with him because
he had undertaken a difficult task, beyond his age and strength, without
consulting them. But without counsel he did nothing; for he had counsel
from the prophet who says, <i>It is good for a man that he bear the yoke
in his youth</i>, and adds, <i>He sitteth alone and keepeth silence because
he hath borne it upon him.</i><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> The youth sat at the feet of Imar (for
that was the man's name) and either <i>learned obedience</i><a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> or showed
that he had learnt it. He sat as one that was at rest, as meek, as
humble. <i>He sat and kept silence</i>,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> knowing, as the prophet says,
that <i>silence is the ornament of righteousness</i>.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> <i>He sat</i> as one
that perseveres, <i>he was silent</i> as one that is modest, except that by
that silence of his he was speaking, with holy David, in the ears of
God: <i>I am a youth and despised, yet do not I forget thy precepts.</i><a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
And for a time <i>he sat alone</i>, because he had neither companion nor
example; for who before Malachy even thought of attempting the most
severe discipline inculcated by the man? It was held by all indeed to be
wonderful, but not imitable. Malachy showed that it was imitable by the
mere act of sitting and keeping silence. In a few days he had imitators
not a few, stirred by his example. So he who at first <i>sat alone</i><a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>

as he was before them in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>conversion,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> so was he more sublime than
they in conversation; and he who came before all, in the judgement of
all was eminent above all in virtue. And he seemed both to his
bishop<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> and to his teacher,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> worthy to be promoted to the degree

<p>6. (4) From this time onwards the Levite<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> of the Lord publicly
girded himself to every work of piety, but more especially to those
things in which there seemed some indignity. In fact it was his greatest
care to attend to the burial of the dead poor,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> because that
savoured not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>less of humility than of humanity. Nor did <i>temptation</i>
fail to test our modern Tobit,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> and, as in the old story, it came
from a woman,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> or rather from the serpent through a woman.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> His
sister,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> abhorring the indignity (as it seemed to her) of his
office, said: "What are you doing, madman? <i>Let the dead bury their
dead.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> And she attacked him daily with this <i>reproach</i>.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> But

ignorant of its force." So he maintained with devotion, and exercised
unweariedly the ministry which he had undertaken under compulsion. <span class="sidenote">1119(?)</span>For
that reason also they<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> deemed that the office of the priesthood
should be conferred upon him. And this was done. But when he was
ordained priest he was about twenty-five years old.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> And if in both
his ordinations the rule of the Canons seems to have been somewhat
disregarded&mdash;as indeed does seem to have been the case, for he received
the Levitical ministry before his twenty-fifth, and the dignity of the
priesthood before his thirtieth year<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>&mdash;it may well be

But for my part, I consider that such irregularity should neither be
condemned in the case of a saint, nor deliberately claimed by him who is
not a saint. <span class="sidenote">1120.</span>Not content with this the bishop also committed to him his

<p>7. In fine whatsoever came to his notice which was irregular or
unbecoming or perverse his <i>eye did not spare</i>;<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> but as the hail

might to drive out before his face and destroy entirely such things from
his people. And in place of all these the most excellent legislator
delivered the heavenly laws. He made regulations full of righteousness,
full of moderation and integrity. Moreover in all churches he ordained
the apostolic sanctions and the decrees of the holy fathers, and
especially the customs of the holy Roman Church.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> Hence it is that
to this day there is chanting and psalmody in them at the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>canonical
hours after the fashion of the whole world. For there was no such thing
before, not even in the city.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> He, however, had learnt singing in

yet none in the city, nor in the whole bishopric, could or would sing.
Then Malachy instituted anew<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> the most wholesome usage of
Confession,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> the Sacrament of Confirmation, the Marriage

And let these serve as an example of the rest, for [here] and through
the whole course of the history we omit much for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p>8. (5). Since he had a desire and a very great zeal for the honouring of
the divine offices and the veneration of the sacraments, lest by chance
he might ordain or teach anything concerning these matters otherwise
than that which was in accordance with the rite of the universal Church,
it came into his mind to visit Bishop Malchus,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>that he might give
him fuller information on all points. He was <i>an old man, full of
days</i><a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> and virtues, and <i>the wisdom of God was in him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> He was
of Irish nationality, but had lived in England in the habit and rule of
a monk in the monastery of Winchester, from which he was promoted to be
bishop in Lismore,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> a city of Munster, and one of the noblest of the
cities of that kingdom. There so great grace was bestowed upon him from
above that he was illustrious, not only for life and doctrine, but also
for signs. Of these I set down two as examples, that it may be known to
all what sort of preceptor Malachy had in the knowledge of holy things.
He healed a boy, who was troubled with a mental disorder, one of those
who are called lunatics, in the act of confirming him with the holy
unction. This was so well known and certain that he soon made him porter
of his house, and the boy lived in good health in that office till he
reached manhood. He restored hearing to one who was deaf; in which
miracle the deaf person acknowledged a wonderful fact, that when the
saint put <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>his fingers into his ears on either side he perceived that
two things like little pigs came out of them. For these and other such
deeds, his fame increased and he won a great name; so that Scots<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>
and Irish flowed together to him and he was reverenced by all as the one
father of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1121</div>

<p>When therefore Malachy, having received the blessing of Father Imar, and
having been sent by the bishop,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> came to him, after a prosperous
journey, he was kindly received by the old man; and he remained with him
for some years,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> in order that by staying so long he might draw
fuller draughts from his aged breast, knowing that which is written,
<i>With the ancient is wisdom.</i><a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> But I suppose that another cause of
his long sojourn was that the great Foreseer of all things would have
His servant Malachy become known to all in a place to which so many
resorted, since he was to be useful to all. For he could not but be dear
to those who knew him. In fact one thing happened in that period, by
which in some <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>measure he made manifest to men what had been known to
God as being in him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1127</div>

<p>9. A conflict having taken place between the king of South
Munster<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>&mdash;which is the southern part of Ireland&mdash;and his
brother,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> and the brother being victorious, the king, driven from
his kingdom, sought refuge with Bishop Malchus.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> It was not,
however, in order that with his help he should recover the kingdom; but
rather the devout prince <i>gave place unto wrath</i><a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> and made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>a virtue
of necessity,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> choosing to lead a private life. And when the bishop
was preparing to receive the king with due honour, he declined it,
saying that he preferred to be as one of those poor brothers who
consorted with him, to lay aside his royal state, and to be content with
the common poverty, rather to await the will of God than to get back his
kingdom by force; and that he would not for his earthly honour <i>shed
man's blood</i>,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> since it would <i>cry unto</i> God against him <i>from the
ground</i>.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> When he heard this the bishop rejoiced greatly, and with
admiration for his devotion satisfied his desire. Why more? The king is
given a poor house for his dwelling, Malachy for his teacher, bread with
salt and water for his food. Moreover for dainties, the presence of
Malachy, his life and doctrine, were sufficient for the king; so that he
might say to him, <i>How sweet are thy words unto my taste, yea, sweeter
than honey to my mouth.</i><a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> Besides, <i>every night he watered his couch
with his tears</i>,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> and also with a daily bath of cold water he
quenched the burning lust for evil in his flesh. And the king prayed in
the words of another king, <i>Look upon my affliction and my pain; and
forgive all my sins.</i><a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> And <i>God did not turn away his prayer nor His
mercy from him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> <i>And his supplication was heard</i>,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> although
otherwise than he had desired. For he was troubled about his soul; but
God, the avenger of innocence, willing to show men <i>that there is a
remainder for the man of peace</i>,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> was preparing meanwhile
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><i>to
execute a judgement for the oppressed</i>,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> which was utterly beyond
his hope. And God <i>stirred up the spirit</i> of a neighbouring <i>king</i>:<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
for Ireland is not one kingdom, but is divided into many. This king
therefore seeing what had been done, was filled with wrath; and
indignant, on the one hand, at the freedom of the raiders and the
insolence of the proud, and on the other, pitying the desolation of the
kingdom and the downfall of the king, he went down to the cell of the
poor man; urged him to return, but did not succeed in persuading him. He
was instant, nevertheless, pledged himself to help him, assured him that
he need not doubt the result, promised that God would be with him, <i>whom
all his adversaries would not be able to resist</i>.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> He laid before
him also the oppression of the poor and the devastation of his country;
yet he prevailed not.</p>

<p>10. But when to these arguments were added the command of the
bishop<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> and the advice of Malachy&mdash;the two men on whom he wholly
depended&mdash;at length, with difficulty, he consented. A king followed a
king, and according to the word of the king,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> <i>as was the will in
heaven</i>,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> the marauders were driven out with absolute ease, and the
man was led back to his own, with great rejoicing of his people, and was
restored to his kingdom. From that time the king loved and always
reverenced Malachy; so much the more because he had learned more fully
in the holy man the things that were worthy of reverence and affection.
For he could not be ignorant of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>holiness of him with whom he had
enjoyed so much intimacy in his adversity. Therefore he honoured him the
more in his prosperity with constant acts of friendship, and faithful
services, <i>and he heard him gladly, and when he heard him did many
things</i>.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> But enough of this. Nevertheless I suppose it was not
without purpose that the Lord so magnified him then <i>before kings</i>,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a>
but <i>he was a chosen vessel unto Him</i>, about <i>to bear His name before
kings</i> and princes.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

Mongair and his father Mughron" died in 1102. This is perhaps sufficient
evidence that Malachy's father was Mughron Ua Morgair, who according to
<i>A.U.</i> was <i>ard fer l&eacute;gind</i> (chief professor) at Armagh, and died at
Mungret, Co. Limerick, on October 5, 1102. Malachy was then only seven
or eight years of age. Thus we may account for the large part taken by
his mother in his early education. But a poem attributed to Malachy
(<i>L.B.</i> 88) calls his father Dermot. The form of the surname varies. It
is usually written Ua Morgair; but <i>A.T.</i>, <i>A.I.</i> (Ua Mongain), <i>L.B.</i>
(<i>l.c.</i>), and the Yellow Book of Lecan (T.C.D. <span class="smcap">ms.</span> H. 2. 16, p. 327 c),
have Ua Mongair. The form Ua Morgair is certainly right, for it appears
in the contemporary Book of Leinster (<i>R.I.A.</i> xxxv. 355-360); and Ua
Mongair obviously arose out of it through confusion of the similar
letters <i>r</i> and <i>n</i>. The name must have been unfamiliar, if it had not
died out, when the mistake was made. Therefore we may accept Colgan's
statement that the family was known as O'Dogherty in his day (<i>Trias</i>,
p. 299). If so, they had probably only resumed an earlier surname: for
according to MacFirbis (Royal Irish Academy <span class="smcap">ms</span>. 23 P. 1, p. 698) Malachy
was of the same stock as St. Mael Brigte, son of Tornan. The latter, as

himself owed to his mother Aleth is well known. See <i>V.P.</i> i. 1, 2, 9,

who founded the monastery of St. Paul and St. Peter at Armagh, and built
a stone church for it which was consecrated on October 21, 1126. It was
placed, either at its foundation or subsequently, under the rule of the
regular canons of St. Augustine. Imar died on pilgrimage at Rome in
1134, and is commemorated in Gorman on August 13, and in Usuard on
November 12. He was at this time evidently leading the life of an
anchoret. Reeves (<i>Churches</i>, p. 28) inferred from his Christian name
that he had some Danish blood in his veins. There is no certain
indication of Malachy's age when he became his disciple. But he had
reached adolescence (&sect; 3), and was old enough to choose his own teachers
(&sect; 2). In 1112 he was seventeen years of age. We shall see that he long
acknowledged Imar as his master: &sect;&sect; 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16.</p></div>

m&oacute;r</i>), on which Cellach put a shingle roof in 1125. According to Reeves
(<i>Churches</i>, pp. 14, 28) it was probably on the site of the present
Cathedral, from which the Abbey of St. Paul and St. Peter was distant
130 yards to the north. It was the principal church of Armagh till 1268.
For an account of the life of such recluses as Imar the reader may be
referred to B. MacCarthy, <i>Codex Palatino-Vaticanus No. 830</i>, p. 5 f.</p></div>

include the two notions of rule and example. It would seem that Malachy
received some sort of monastic rule from Imar. Cp. &sect; 7, "his monastery,"
and the reference to "the first day of his conversion" in &sect; 43. Both
passages imply that he belonged to a religious order. So in &sect; 5 he is
said to have been before the other disciples of Imar "in conversion." On
later occasions he was subject to Imar's "command" (&sect;&sect; 14, 16). It is
not improbable that the disciples who gathered round Imar were the
nucleus of the community which he founded at Armagh (note 1). If so, the
inference is reasonable that Malachy became a regular canon of St.
Augustine.</p></div>

grandson of Maelisa, who was abbot of Armagh 1064-1091. He was born
early in 1080. Of his childhood and youth we know nothing, for the
statement of Meredith Hanmer (<i>Chron. of Ireland</i> (1633), p. 101) that
he is said to have been "brought up at Oxford" is probably as inaccurate
as other assertions which he makes about him. Cellach was elected abbot
of Armagh in August, 1105, and in the following month (September 23) he
received Holy Orders. In 1106, while engaged on a visitation of Munster,
he was consecrated bishop. Thus he departed from the precedent set by
his eight predecessors, who were without orders (&sect; 19). He was one of
the leaders of the Romanizing party in Ireland, and attended the Synod
of Rathbreasail in 1110 (Keating, iii. 307). He died in his fiftieth
year, at Ardpatrick, in co. Limerick, on April 1, 1129, and was buried
on April 4 at Lismore. These facts are mainly gathered from the Annals.

concerned with the burial of the dead. The present passage, indeed,
implies the contrary. Malachy was made deacon against his will; his care
for the dead poor is mentioned as a work of piety, voluntarily
superadded to the duties of his office. His sister (see below) would
have been unlikely to ask him to abandon a practice which he could not
decline. But there was ancient precedent for a deacon engaging in such
work, of which Malachy may have been aware. At Alexandria throughout the
persecution of Valerian, one of the deacons, Eusebius by name, not
without danger to himself, prepared for burial the bodies of "the
perfect and blessed martyrs" (Eus., <i>H.E.</i> vii. 11. 24).</p></div>

age of deacons and priests reference may be made to the article "Orders,
Holy," by the late Dr. Edwin Hatch in the <i>Dictionary of Christian
Antiquities</i>, vol. ii. p. 1482 f. From a very early date they were
respectively twenty-five and thirty years, in accordance with the
statement of the text, though there were some exceptions in remote
places. The eighth-century Irish Canons, known as the <i>Hibernensis</i>,
prescribe the same minimum ages for the diaconate and presbyterate, and
add a clause, the gist of which seems to be that a bishop at the time of
his consecration must be thirty or forty years of age (Wasserschleben,
<i>Irische Kanonesammlung</i>, 1885, p. 8). As late as the year 1089, at the

5, Mansi, xx. 723) that none should be admitted deacon under twenty-four
or twenty-five years of age, or priest under thirty. But at the Council
of Ravenna, 1315 (can. 2, <i>ibid.</i> xxv. 537), the ages were lowered to
twenty and twenty-five respectively.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_218_218" id="Footnote_218_218"></a><a href="#FNanchor_218_218"><span class="label">[218]</span></a> Cellach would hardly have understood the need for this
apology. It is more than probable that he was ignorant of the canons
referred to. He himself was ordained, apparently to the priesthood, in
1105, when he was under twenty-six, and consecrated bishop in 1106, when
he was under twenty-seven years of age. St. Bernard himself seems to
have been ordained priest when he was about twenty-five years old
(Vacandard, i. 67).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_219_219" id="Footnote_219_219"></a><a href="#FNanchor_219_219"><span class="label">[219]</span></a> In other words he made him his vicar. This may well have
been in 1120; for the Annals record that in that year Cellach made a
visitation of Munster. It was quite natural that during a prolonged
absence from his see he should leave its administration in the hands of
one who had proved himself so capable as Malachy. And we shall see that
this date harmonizes with other chronological data. If, then, we place
the beginning of Malachy's vicariate in 1120, his ordination as priest,
which appears to have been not much earlier, may be dated in 1119, when
he was "about twenty-five years of age," <i>i.e.</i> probably soon after his
twenty-fourth birthday. His admission to the diaconate may be placed at
least a year earlier, <i>i.e.</i> in 1118. Indeed, if we could be sure that
in Ireland the normal interval between admission to the diaconate and to
the priesthood was at all as long as in other countries we might put it
further back.</p></div>

Latin documents, though a native of Ireland, had been a monk of
Winchester, as we are here told. He was elected first bishop of the
Danish colony of Waterford in 1096, and was consecrated by Anselm,
assisted by the bishops of Chichester and Rochester, at Canterbury on
December 28, having previously made his profession of obedience to the
archbishop as one of his suffragans (Eadmer, p. 76 f.; Ussher, pp. 518,
565). He signed the Acts of the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1110 as
archbishop of Cashel (Keating, iii. 307). He had probably been
translated to that see shortly after its foundation in 1106 (see below,
p. 65, n. 4). The Synod of Rathbreasail enlarged the Danish diocese of
Waterford by adding to it an extensive non-Danish area, which included
the ancient religious site of Lismore, on which St. Carthach or Mochuta
had founded a community in the early part of the seventh century
(Lanigan, ii. 353). The Synod decreed that the see of this diocese
should be either at Lismore or at Waterford, apparently giving
preference to the former (see p. xlvii). It would seem that after
organizing the diocese of Cashel Malchus retired to his former "parish,"
just as at a later date Malachy retired from Armagh to Down (&sect; 31),
placing his see at Lismore. There, at any rate, he was established when
Malachy visited him, and there he died in 1135 "after the 88th year of
his pilgrimage" (<i>A.F.M.</i>). An attempt has been made to distinguish Mael
Isa Ua hAinmire from the Malchus of the text (Lanigan, iv. 74), but
without success. It is interesting to observe that both <i>A.F.M.</i> and
<i>A.T.</i> style him bishop of Waterford in the record of his death.</p></div>

considerable time if the account of his labours in that capacity (&sect; 7)
is not grossly exaggerated. Hence, if his vicariate began in 1119 or
1120 his departure for Lismore can hardly have been earlier than 1121;
and as he spent "some years" there before he was raised to the
episcopate (1124; see &sect; 16), it cannot have been later. Samuel O'Hanley,
bishop of Dublin, died on July 4, 1121, and Cellach at once made an
attempt, which proved unsuccessful, to take possession of the vacant
see. Samuel's successor, Gregory, was duly elected, and was consecrated
at Lambeth on October 2. (<i>O.C.C.</i> p. 31; <i>A.U.</i> 1121; John of
Worcester, ed. J. H. R. Weaver, 1908, p. 16; Ussher, 532). It may have
been in August or September, on the return of Cellach from Dublin, that
Malachy was released from his office and went to Lismore.</p></div>

Carthy, son of Teague Mac Carthy, who succeeded his father as king of
Desmond (South Munster) in 1124. He was never king of the whole of
Munster. That he went to Lismore in 1121 is very probable. For the
Annals tell us that in that year Turlough O'Conor, king of Connaught,
invaded Desmond, and "arrived at the termon of Lismore" (<i>A.I.</i> say that
he destroyed Lismore, which can hardly be true). What more likely than
that one of the sons of Teague, the reigning monarch of Desmond, should
fly before that formidable warrior to the sanctuary of Mochuta? But St.
Bernard errs in supposing that he was then king of Desmond. On Cormac,

historical, but that St. Bernard has misplaced it, is proved by the
following extract from <i>A.T.</i> under the year 1127: "A hosting by
Toirdelbach, king of Ireland [really of Connaught], till he reached
Corcach, he himself on land and his fleet at sea going round to Corcach,
ravaging Munster by sea and by land so that he drove Cormac mac meic
Carthaig into Lismore in pilgrimage. And Toirdelbach divided Munster
into two parts, the southern half [Desmond] to Donnchad mac meic
Carthaig; and the northern half [Thomond] to Conchobar o Briain....
Cormac mac meic Carthaig came from his pilgrimage, and made an alliance
with Conchobar o Briain and with all the men of Muma, save those of
Tuathmuma. Donnchad mac meic Carthaig came from them&mdash;for he was not in
the alliance&mdash;with 2000 men."
</p><p>
The other Annals have notices to the same effect. These events occurred
in 1127, three years after Malachy returned from his long stay at
Lismore, and was made bishop of Connor (&sect; 16). If he had the part which
is ascribed to him in the restoration of Cormac, he must therefore have
paid two visits to Lismore, which St. Bernard has confounded. That he
was in the south of Ireland for a considerable time prior to 1129 will
appear later (p. 40, n. 2).</p></div>

<p class="subhead2a"><i>Malachy's pity for his deceased sister. He restores the Monastery of
Bangor. His first Miracles.</i></p>


<p>11. (6). Meanwhile Malachy's sister, whom we mentioned before,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
died: and we must not pass over the visions which he saw about her. For
the saint indeed abhorred her carnal life, and with such intensity that
he vowed he would never see her alive in the flesh. But now that her
flesh was destroyed his vow was also destroyed, and he began to see in
spirit her whom in the body he would not see. One night he heard in a
dream the voice of one saying to him that his sister was standing
outside in the court, and that for thirty entire days she had tasted
nothing; and when he awoke he soon understood the sort of food for want
of which she was pining away. And when he had diligently considered the
number of days which he had heard, he discovered that it went back to
the time when he had ceased to offer the <i>living bread from heaven</i><a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a>
for her. Then, since he hated not the soul of his sister but her sin, he
began again the good practice which he had abandoned. And not in vain.
Not long after she was seen by him to have come to the threshold of the
church, but to be not yet able to enter; she appeared also in dark
raiment. And when <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>he persevered, taking care that on no single day she
should be disappointed of the accustomed gift, he saw her a second time
in whitish raiment, admitted indeed within the church, but not allowed
to approach the altar. At last she was seen, a third time, gathered in
the company of the white-robed, and <i>in bright clothing</i>.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> You see,

<p>12. (7). The Lord, indeed, was so preparing His beloved Malachy in the
district of Lismore for the glory of His name. But those who had sent
him,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> tolerating his absence no longer, recalled him by letters.
When he was restored to his people,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> now better instructed in all
that was necessary, behold <i>a work prepared</i> and kept by <i>God</i><a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> for
Malachy. A rich and powerful man, who held the place of Bangor and its
possessions, by inspiration of God immediately placed in his hand all
that he had and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>himself as well.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> And he was his mother's
brother.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> But kinship of spirit was of more value to Malachy than
kinship of the flesh. The actual place also of Bangor, from which he
received his name,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> the prince<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> made over to him, that there he
might build, or rather rebuild, a monastery. For indeed there had been
formerly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>a very celebrated one under the first father, Comgall,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a>
which produced many thousands of monks, and was the head of many
monasteries. A truly holy place it was and prolific of saints, <i>bringing
forth</i> most abundant <i>fruit to God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> so that one of the sons of
that holy community, Lugaid<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> by name, is said to have been the
founder&mdash;himself alone&mdash;of a hundred monasteries. I mention this in
order that the reader may infer from this one instance what an immense
number of others there were. In fine, to such an extent did its shoots
fill Ireland and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Scotland<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> that those verses of David seem to have
sung beforehand especially of these times, <i>Thou visitest the earth and
blessest it; thou makest it very plenteous. The river of God is full of
water: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest for the earth,
blessing its rivers, multiplying its shoots. With its drops of rain
shall it rejoice while it germinates</i>;<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> and in like manner the
verses that follow. Nor was it only into the regions just mentioned, but
also into foreign lands that those swarms of saints poured forth as
though a <i>flood had risen</i>;<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> of whom one, St. Columbanus, came up to
our Gallican parts, and built the monastery of Luxovium, and was <i>made
there a great people</i>.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> So great a people was it, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>say, that
the choirs succeeding one another in turn, the solemnities of the divine
offices went on continuously, so that not a moment day or night was
empty of praises.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<p>13. (8) Enough has been said about the ancient glory of the monastery of
Bangor. This, long ago destroyed by pirates,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> Malachy eagerly
cherished on account of its remarkable and long-standing prestige, as
though he were about to <i>replant a paradise</i>,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> and because <i>many
bodies of the saints slept</i> there.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> For, not to speak of those which
were <i>buried in peace</i>,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> it is said that nine hundred persons were
slain together in one day by pirates.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> Vast, indeed, were the
possessions of that place;<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> but Malachy, content with the holy place
alone, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>resigned all the possessions and lands to another. For indeed
from the time when the monastery was destroyed there was always someone
to hold it with its possessions. For they were both appointed by
election and were even called abbots, preserving in name but not in fact
what had once been.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> And though many urged him not to alienate the
possessions, but to retain the whole together for himself, this lover of
poverty did not consent, but caused one to be elected, according to
custom, to hold them; the place, as we have said, being retained for
Malachy and his followers. And perhaps, as afterwards appeared,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> he
would have been wiser to have kept it all; only he looked more to
humility than to peace.</p>

<p>14. So, then, by the command of Father Imar, taking with him about ten
brethren, he came to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>place and began to build. And there, one day,
when he himself was cutting with an axe, by chance one of the workmen,
while he was brandishing the axe in the air, carelessly got into the
place at which the blow was aimed, and it fell on his spine with as much
force as Malachy could strike. He fell, and all ran to him supposing
that he had received a death-wound or was dead. And indeed his tunic was
<i>rent from the top to the bottom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> but the man himself was found
unhurt, the skin so very slightly grazed that scarcely a trace appeared
on the surface. The man whom the axe had laid low, stood unharmed while
the bystanders beheld him with amazement. Hence they became more eager,
and were found readier for the work. And <i>this was the beginning of the
miracles</i><a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> of Malachy. Moreover the oratory was finished in a few
days, made of smoothed planks indeed, but closely and strongly fastened
together&mdash;a Scotic work,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> not devoid of beauty.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> And
thenceforward God <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>was served in it as in the ancient days; that is,
with similar devotion, though not with like numbers. Malachy presided
over that place for some time,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> by the ordinance of Father
Imar,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> being at once the ruler and the rule of the brethren. They
read in his life how they should behave themselves, and he was their
leader <i>in righteousness and holiness before God</i>;<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> save that
besides the things appointed for the whole community he did many things
of an exceptional kind, in which he still more was the leader of all,
and none of the others was able to follow him to such difficult
practices.</p>

<p>At that time and place a certain man was sick, and the devil stood by
him and suggested in plain speech that he should never heed the
admonitions of Malachy, but if he should enter his house, he should
attack and kill him with a knife. And when this became known, those who
ministered to him, the sick man himself informing them, brought word to
Malachy and warned him. But he, seizing his accustomed weapons of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>prayer, boldly attacked his enemy, and put to flight both disease and
demon. <i>But the</i> man's <i>name was Malchus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> He is brother according
to the flesh of our Christian, abbot of Mellifont.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> For both are

delivered, immediately he was not ungrateful, but in the same place,
having <i>turned<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> to the Lord</i>,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> he changed both his habit and his
mind. And the brethren knew that the evil one was envious of their
prosperity; and they were edified and made more careful henceforth.</p>

<p>15. (9). At the same place he healed a cleric, named Michael, who was
suffering from dysentery and despaired of, by sending him something from
his table. A second time, when the same person was smitten with a very
grave disorder, he cured him both in body and mind. And from that moment
<i>he clave to</i> God<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> and to Malachy His servant, fearing <i>lest a worse
thing should come unto him</i>,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> if once more he should be found
ungrateful for so great a benefit and miracle. And at present, as we
have heard, he presides over a monastery in the parts of Scotland; and
this was the latest of all Malachy's foundations.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> Through such
deeds of Malachy both his reputation and his community increased daily,
and his name became great both within and without the monastery, though
not greater than the fact. For <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>indeed he dwelt<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> there even after he
was made bishop, for the place was near the city.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

founder of Bangor. It would seem that he had been but a short time in
office, for Oengus O'Gorman, coarb of Comgall, died at Lismore in 1123
(<i>A.U.</i>), probably during Malachy's sojourn there. It is not impossible
that the unnamed coarb, mentioned in the text, was Murtough O'Hanratty,
who died at Armagh in 1131 (<i>A.F.M.</i>). The statement that he gave
"himself" to Malachy seems to mean that he placed himself under his rule
in the new community.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_285_285" id="Footnote_285_285"></a><a href="#FNanchor_285_285"><span class="label">[285]</span></a> If the identification suggested in the preceding note is
correct, Malachy's mother belonged to the family of O'Hanratty, which in
the eleventh and twelfth centuries held the chieftaincy of Ui M&eacute;ith
Macha or Ui M&eacute;ith T&iacute;re, now the barony of Monaghan, in the county of the
same name.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_286_286" id="Footnote_286_286"></a><a href="#FNanchor_286_286"><span class="label">[286]</span></a> <i>Cognominabatur.</i> This verb occurs seventeen times in the
Vulgate, and almost always indicates a new or alternative name. In the
present passage it certainly applies, not to Malachy's baptismal name,
but to its Latin equivalent, Malachias, which he probably assumed when
he became abbot of Bangor, or bishop of Down. The remark that he
received it from Bangor is to be explained thus. A legend, which has a
place in Jocelin's <i>Life of St. Patrick</i> (&sect; 98) and is therefore at
least as old as the twelfth century, relates that Patrick, viewing the
valley in which the monastery of Comgall was afterwards constructed,
perceived that it was "filled with a multitude of the heavenly host."
From this story, no doubt, came the name "Valley of Angels (<i>Vallis
Angelorum</i>)," by which it was known in the early seventeenth century,
and probably long before (Reeves, p. 199). If this name, or the legend
on which it was based, was known to Malachy it is quite conceivable that
on account of his connexion with Bangor, he adopted, as the Latin
alternative of M&aacute;el M&aacute;ed&oacute;c, a name which is only the Hebrew for <i>my
angel</i> with a Latin termination. That St. Bernard was aware of the
significance of the name, and liked to dwell upon it, is clear from
Sermon ii. &sect; 5. It may be added that the legend just mentioned is
connected with a folk-etymology of the word Bangor (<i>Bennchor</i>) which
explained it as "white choir." For the true etymology see Kuno Meyer,
"Zur Keltischen Wortkunde," &sect; 66 (<i>Preuss. Akad. Sitz.</i>, 1913).</p></div>

donor of Bangor was a secular chieftain. St. Bernard is somewhat
arbitrary in his use of such titles; and <i>princeps</i> occurs very
frequently in <i>A.U.</i> up to the tenth century as an equivalent of
<i>abbot</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_288_288" id="Footnote_288_288"></a><a href="#FNanchor_288_288"><span class="label">[288]</span></a> Comgall, who was a Pict of D&aacute;l Araide (Adamnan, i. 49),
was born at Magheramorne, near Larne, co. Antrim (Reeves, p. 269),
between 516 and 520. He founded the monastery of Bangor when he was
about forty years old, probably in 559, and presided over it till his
death in 602 (<i>A.U.</i>). According to his Latin Life (&sect; 13, Plummer, ii.
7), so great a number of monks came to him there that there was not room
for them; "he therefore founded very many cells and many monasteries,
not only in the district of Ulaid, but throughout the other provinces of
Ireland." There were as many as 3000 monks under his rule. On the last
leaf of an ancient service book of the monastery, known as the
Antiphonary of Bangor (Facsimile edition by F. E. Warren, 1893, vol. ii.
p. 33), there is a hymn which gives a complete list of the
abbots&mdash;fifteen in number&mdash;from Comgall to Cronan (&#8224; 691), in
whose period of office it was written. The site of St. Comgall's
monastery is beside the Rectory of the parish of Bangor, co. Down, about
half-a-mile from Bangor Bay, near the entrance to Belfast Lough.</p></div>

of Lismore in Scotland, who died in 592 (<i>A.U.</i>) and is commemorated on
June 25 (Oengus, Gorman). He was a Pict and of the same tribe as St.
Comgall, both being descended from Fiacha Araide (<i>L.B.</i> 15 c, e); and
in later times was the patron saint of the diocese of Argyll (Adamnan,
p. 371). He may be the Bishop Lugidus who ordained St. Comgall, and
afterwards restrained him from leaving Ireland (Plummer, i. p. lix.; ii.
pp. 6, 7). But there is no evidence, apart from the statement of St.
Bernard, that either this bishop or Lugaid of Lismore was a member of
the community at Bangor. There is a Life of Lugaid of Lismore in the
Breviary of Aberdeen (Prop. Sanct. pro temp, aest. ff. 5 <i>v.</i> 7;
summarized in Forbes, <i>Kalendars of Scottish Saints</i>, p. 410). His
principal foundation after Lismore was Rosemarkie in Ross. Mr. A. B.
Scott (<i>Pictish Nation</i>, 1918, p. 347 f.) mentions also Mortlach
(Banffshire) and Clova (Aberdeenshire); and Bishop Forbes (<i>l.c.</i>) adds
other sites with which his name is connected.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_291_291" id="Footnote_291_291"></a><a href="#FNanchor_291_291"><span class="label">[291]</span></a> St. Comgall himself is said to have been minded in his
earlier days to go on pilgrimage to "Britain," and to have been
dissuaded therefrom by Lugaid (Latin Life, &sect; 13, Plummer, ii. 7). Seven
years after the foundation of Bangor he went to Britain to visit
"certain saints" (<i>ibid.</i> &sect; 22, p. 11). It was probably on this occasion
that he spent some time on the island of Hinba (Eilean-na-naomh?) in the
company of SS. Columba, Canice and others (Adamnan, iii. 17). It was
somewhat later, apparently, that St. Columba went with some companions
on a mission to Brude, king of the Picts (<i>ibid.</i> ii. 35); and we need
not question the statement that Comgall and Canice were among those who
went with him, though there is reason to doubt that Comgall was the
leader of the band, as his Life implies (&sect; 51, p. 18), and though the
<i>Life of St. Canice</i>, which frequently refers to his visit, or visits,
to Scotland (&sect;&sect; 17, 19, 21, 23, Plummer, i. 158), never mentions the
incident. It is probable, therefore, that the founder of Bangor took

monasteries founded by him in that country, besides the community in the

been preserved to later ages. Mr. Scott credits members of the community

Irish missionaries on the Continent of Europe. Born in Leinster,
according to Bruno Krusch (<i>Ionae Vitae Sanctorum</i>, p. 22) in 530, or as
others hold in 543, he entered the community of Bangor not long after
its foundation, and after spending "many cycles of years" there, he
sailed for France about 590. His principal monasteries were Luxeuil
(Luxovium) in the department of Haute Sa&ocirc;ne, and Bobbio in Lombardy. At
the latter place he died, November 23, 615. His Life was written by
Jonas, about 640. It was critically edited by Krusch in <i>M.G.H.</i>
(Script. rerum Merovingic., vol. iv. 1-152) and subsequently as a
separate volume (<i>Ionae Vitae Sanctorum Columbani, Vedastis, Iohannis</i>,
1905). The story of his labours has been told by G. T. Stokes in his
<i>Celtic Church in Ireland</i>, Lect. vii., and by many other modern
writers. See also the collection of documents in Patrick Fleming's
<i>Collectanea</i> (Lovanii, 1667). Luxeuil is about eighty miles from
Clairvaux, and less than seventy from St. Bernard's early home at Dijon.
Fifty years after the death of St. Columbanus it adopted the rule of St.
Benedict. It was a well-known establishment in St. Bernard's day, though
by that time its glory had declined. It was suppressed in 1789 (M.
Stokes, <i>Three Months in the Forests of France</i>, p. 67).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_302_302" id="Footnote_302_302"></a><a href="#FNanchor_302_302"><span class="label">[302]</span></a> This remark is interesting as showing that the title
"abbot of Bangor" was in use in the twelfth century. The last person to
whom it is given in the <i>A.U.</i> is Indrechtach, who died in 906. From
that time onwards "coarb of Comgall" (or in one instance, "coarb of
Bangor") is substituted for it. St. Bernard is supported by the Annals
when he asserts that so-called abbots were elected down to Malachy's
time. <i>A.U.</i> preserve the names of twenty abbots or coarbs between 824
and 1123. But St. Bernard leaves the impression that the religious
community of Bangor ceased to exist on its destruction by the Norse
pirates, and that subsequently the "abbots" merely held the lands that
had belonged to it, and exercised no spiritual discipline. There are
good reasons, however, for the contrary opinion. Thus Abbot Moengal, who
died in 871, was a "pilgrim." Abbot Moenach (died 921) was "the head of
the learning of the island of Ireland." Ceile, coarb of Comgall, went on
pilgrimage to Rome in 928, and died there in 929: he was a scribe and
anchoret, apostolic doctor of all Ireland, and (if <i>C.S.</i> can be
trusted) a bishop. Dubhinnsi, bishop of Bangor, died in 953. Finally,
Diarmait Ua Maeltelcha, coarb of Comgall, whom <i>C.S.</i> calls a bishop,
died in 1016. It was probably not till after that date, as Reeves (p.
154) assures us, that the monastery began to decline.</p></div>

earlier meaning as equivalent to "Irish." From this departure from his
ordinary usage (see p. 20, note 1) we may infer that St. Bernard is
quoting the words of his authority. The habit of constructing churches
of wood prevailed in early times among the Celtic and Saxon tribes in
the British Isles, the introduction of stone building for such purposes
being due to Roman influence (Plummer, <i>Bede</i>, ii. 101). The older
custom lingered longer in Ireland than elsewhere; and by the time of
Bede it had come to be regarded as characteristically Irish, though
wooden churches must still have been numerous in England (Bede, <i>H.E.</i>,
iii. 25). In a document of much later date, the Life of the Irish Saint
Monenna (quoted in Adamnan, p. 177 f.), we read of "a church constructed
of smoothed planks according to the custom of the Scottish races"; and
the writer adds that "the Scots are not in the habit of building walls,
or causing them to be built." Petrie (pp. 138-151) maintained that stone
churches were not unusual in early Ireland; but he admits (pp. 341-344)
that one type of church&mdash;the oratory (in Irish <i>dairtheach</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
house of oak)&mdash;was very rarely constructed of stone. The only two
passages which he cites (p. 345) as mentioning stone oratories (he says
he might have produced others) are not to his purpose. The first is a
notice in <i>A.U.</i> 788, of a man being killed at the door of a "stone
oratory": but another, and apparently better, reading substitutes
<i>lapide</i> for <i>lapidei</i>, thus altering the entry to a statement that the
man was killed "by a stone at the door of the oratory." The second is
Colgan's rendering (<i>Trias</i>, p. 162) of a sentence in <i>Trip.</i> iii. 74,
p. 232, in which there is in reality no mention of any ecclesiastical
edifice. So far as I am aware, there is no indisputable reference in
Irish literature to a stone oratory earlier than the one mentioned
below, &sect; 61.</p></div>

who used it well. For who knows that God did not wish to destroy by such
a scourge the ancient evils of His people? By a necessity so dire
Malachy was compelled, and he retired with a crowd of his disciples. Nor
was his retirement spent in idleness. It gave opportunity for building

was in his kingdom. The king rejoiced to see Malachy, placing at the
disposal of him and those who were with him himself and all that he
had&mdash;as one who was neither ungrateful nor unmindful of a benefit. Many
beasts were immediately brought for the use of the brothers; much gold
and silver was also supplied, with regal munificence, for the expense of
the buildings. He himself also <i>was coming in and going out with

consecration it was the see of a diocese which included Bangor (&sect; 15)
and Down, the present Downpatrick (&sect; 31). The inference is highly
probable that it included the whole district which constituted the
"parish [<i>i.e.</i> diocese] of Connor," according to the decree of the
Synod of Rathbreasail in 1110 (Keating, iii. 303: see above p. xli),
that is to say, roughly, the present united dioceses of Down, Connor and
Dromore. It would seem that Malachy was its first bishop.</p></div>

elapsed between Malachy's return from Lismore and his consecration; for
the reason given in &sect; 12 for his recall is inconsistent with the
supposition that he had already been elected to a bishopric which
Cellach and Imar wished him to accept. They desired to have him with
them at Armagh. He must have been "elected" either while he was at
Armagh or after he went to Bangor.</p></div>

under the year 1124 that "Mael Maedoc Ua Morgair sat in the bishopric of
Connor." This agrees with the date of his consecration as given here.
See p. 128, note 1. He was consecrated bishop by Cellach (&sect; 19).
</p><p>
We have seen (p. 20, note 3) that Malachy probably went to Lismore late
in 1121. He spent several years there, and, according to St. Bernard,
another long period at Armagh and Bangor before his consecration in
1124. This must be pronounced impossible. The most probable solution of
the chronological difficulty is that through ignorance of Irish
ecclesiastical affairs St. Bernard misunderstood the information
supplied to him, and thus separated Malachy's tenure of the abbacy of
Bangor from his episcopate, though the two were in reality conterminous.
For the significance of Malachy's recall to the North, see Introduction,
p. liii. f.; and for a fuller discussion, <i>R.I.A.</i>, xxxv. 250-254.</p></div>

Ireland in the Annals (s.a. 1136). He succeeded his father Donnell as
king of Ailech (Grenan Ely, co. Donegal, the residence of the kings of
the northern Ui Neill) in 1121, and the next year he invaded the
northern part of Ulaid, the district in which Bangor is situated. He
invaded Magh Cobha (Iveagh, co. Down) and Bregha (Meath), with the help
of the Dal Araide (the district round Connor, co. Antrim) in 1128. He
finally subdued Ulaid in 1130, and "plundered the country as far as the
east of Ard [<i>i.e.</i> the baronies of the Ards, in which lies Bangor],
both lay and ecclesiastical property." He was murdered on May 25, 1136
(<i>A.U.</i>, <i>A.L.C.</i>). It has been supposed that the expedition of 1130 was
the occasion of the destruction of Bangor mentioned in the text. But St.
Bernard places it, and the consequent departure of Malachy to the south,
before the death of Cellach in 1129 (&sect; 19), and we have found reason to
believe that Malachy was at Lismore in 1127 (p. 21, n. 3). Though no
raid by Conor in that year is referred to in the Annals, that fact
cannot be regarded as proof that none took place.</p></div>

in the county of Kerry, north of the estuary of the Kenmare River, and
in Cormac Mac Carthy's kingdom of Desmond, was apparently first
suggested by Lanigan (iv. 92). The identification is almost certainly
correct. It is more difficult to determine the part of the barony in
which the monastery was situated. O'Hanlon suggested Church Island, near
Cahirciveen, where there are some ecclesiastical remains, traditionally
known half a century ago as "the monastery" (<i>R.I.A.</i> xv. 107). But
these appear to be of much earlier date than the twelfth century. More
plausible is the conjecture of the Rev. Denis O'Donoghue, that the site
is on another Church Island, in Lough Currane, near Waterville. On it
are the ruins of a church which, in the opinion of Mr. P. J. Lynch, was
built in the twelfth century (<i>J.R.S.A.I.</i> xxx. 159 f.). Malachy seems
to have spent some time at Lismore before going to Iveragh.</p></div>

him the Bangor community, or the greater part of it, and made a new home
for it in Iveragh. If so the inference is obvious that up to 1127
Malachy resided at Bangor, and was still abbot.</p></div>

people&mdash;for he was a good and devout man&mdash;took all care to have Malachy
as his successor, because he believed that by him this evilly rooted
succession might be torn up,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> since he was dear to all, and one whom
all were zealous to imitate, <i>and the Lord was with him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> Nor was
he deceived of his hope; for when he died Malachy was put into
occupation in his room. But not soon nor easily. For behold there is one
of the evil seed to seize the place&mdash;Murtough by name.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> For five
years, relying on the secular power,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> this man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>fastened himself
upon the church, not a bishop but a tyrant. For the wishes of the devout
had rather supported the claim of Malachy. At last they urged him to
undertake the burden according to the ordinance of Cellach. But he, who
shunned every high office as nothing else than his downfall,<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">383</a>
thought that he had found good ground of excuse, because at that time it
was impossible that he should have a peaceful entry. All were eager for
so holy a work and pressed him; especially the two bishops, Malchus<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">384</a>
and Gilbert,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> of whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>the former was the elder<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> of Lismore
mentioned above, the second he who is said to have been the first to
exercise the office of legate of the Apostolic See throughout the whole
of Ireland. These, when three years had now passed in this presumption
of Murtough and dissimulation of Malachy,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> tolerating no longer the
adultery of the church and the dishonour of Christ, called together the
bishops and princes of the land,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> and came, in one spirit, to
Malachy, prepared to use force. But he refused at first; pleading the
difficulty of the project, the numbers, strength and ambition of that
noble stock, urging that it was a great venture for him, a poor man and
of no account, to oppose himself to men so many, so great, of such sort,
so deeply rooted, who now for well-nigh two hundred years had <i>held</i> as
<i>by hereditary right the sanctuary of God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> and now also had taken
possession of it before him; that they could not be rooted out, not even
at the cost of human life; that it was not to his advantage that <i>man's
blood should be shed</i><a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> on his account; and lastly, that he was
joined to another spouse<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> whom <i>it was</i> not <i>lawful for him to put
away</i>.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p>21. (14). But when they persisted eagerly in the contrary opinion, and
cried out that the <i>word had come <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>forth from the Lord</i>,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> and
moreover ordered him with all authority to undertake the burden, and
threatened him with an anathema, he said, "You are leading me to death,
but I obey in the hope of martyrdom; yet on this condition, that if, as
you expect, the enterprise has good success, and God frees his
<i>heritage</i> from <i>those that are destroying</i> it,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> all being then at
length completed, and the church<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> at peace, it may be lawful for me
to return to my former spouse and friend, poverty,<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> from which I am
carried off, and to put in my place there another, if then one is found
fit for it." Note, reader, the courage of the man and the purity of his
purpose who, for Christ's name, neither sought honour nor dreaded death.
What could be purer or what braver than this purpose, that after
exposing himself to peril and labour he should yield to another the
fruit&mdash;peace and security itself in the place of authority? And this he
does, retaining for himself according to agreement a free return to
poverty when peace and freedom are restored to the church. When they
gave the pledge, at length he assented to their will; or rather to the
will of God, who, he remembered, had long foreshown to him this
occurrence, at the fulfilment of which he was now grieved. For indeed
when Cellach was already ailing there appeared to Malachy&mdash;far away and
ignorant [of Cellach's condition]&mdash;a woman of great stature and reverend
mien. When he inquired who she was, the answer was given that she was
the wife of Cellach.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> And she gave him a pastoral staff which she
held in her hand, and then <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>disappeared. A few days later, Cellach, when
he was dying, sent his staff to Malachy, indicating that he should
succeed him: and when he saw it he recognized that it was the same which
he had seen [in vision]. It was the remembrance of this vision which
specially put Malachy in fear, lest if he still refused he might seem to
<i>resist</i> the Divine <i>will</i>, which he had ignored long enough.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> But
he did not enter the city as long as that intruder lived, lest by such
act it should happen that any one of those should die to whom he came
rather to minister life. Thus for two years (for so long the other
survived), living outside the town, he strenuously performed the
episcopal office throughout the whole province.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></p>

<p>22. (15). When that person, then, had been removed by sudden death,<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a>
again one Niall [<i>Nigellus</i>] (in truth <i>nigerrimus</i>, very black)<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>
quickly took possession of the see. And in appointing him as his
successor, Murtough, while he was still alive, <i>made provision for his
life</i>:<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> he was going forth to be damned, but in the person of Niall
he would go on adding to the works of damnation.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> For he also was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>of the damned race, a relative of Murtough.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> But the king<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> and
the bishops and faithful of the land nevertheless came together that
they might bring in Malachy. And lo, there was an <i>assembly of the
wicked</i><a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> to oppose them.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> A certain man of the sons of Belial,
ready for <i>mischief, mighty in iniquity</i>,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> who <i>knew the place</i>

and secretly seized a neighbouring high hill opposite to it, intending,
when they were engaged with other things, suddenly to rush upon them
unawares and <i>murder the innocent</i>.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> For they had agreed to butcher
the king also with the bishop, that there might be none to <i>avenge the
righteous blood</i>.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> The plan became known to Malachy, and he entered
the church, which was close by, and lifted up his hands in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>prayer to
the Lord. Lo, there came <i>clouds and darkness</i>,<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> yea also <i>dark
waters and thick clouds of the skies<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> changed the day into

<p>23. But that you may know, reader, that it was the prayer of Malachy
that roused the elements, the tempest fell upon those <i>who sought his
life</i>,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> the <i>dark whirlwind</i><a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> enveloped only those who had made
ready <i>the works of darkness</i>.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> Finally, he who was the leader of so
great wickedness was struck by a thunderbolt and perished with three
others, companions in death as they had been partners in crime; and the
next day their bodies were found half-burnt and putrid, clinging to the
branches of trees, each where the wind<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> <i>had lifted him up and cast
him down</i>.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> Three others also were found half dead; the rest were
all scattered in every direction. But, as for those who were with
Malachy, though they were close to the place, the storm <i>touched them
not at all, neither troubled them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> In that fact we find fresh
proof of the truth of that saying, <i>The prayer of the righteous pierceth
the heavens.</i><a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> It is also a new example of the ancient miracle, by
which in former times, when all Egypt was in darkness, Israel alone
remained in light, as the Scripture says, <i>Wheresoever Israel was there
was light.</i><a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> In this connexion occurs to me also what holy Elijah
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>did, at one time bringing clouds and rain from the ends of the
earth,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> at another, calling down fire from heaven on the
revilers.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> And now in like manner <i>God is glorified in</i><a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> His
servant Malachy.</p>

<p>24. (16). In the thirty-eighth year of his age,<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> the usurper having
been driven out, the poor man, Malachy, entered Armagh, pontiff and
metropolitan of all Ireland. But when the king and the others who had
brought him in returned home,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> he remained <i>in the hand of
God</i>;<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> and there remained for him <i>without fightings, within
fears</i>.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> For, lo, the viperous brood, raging and crying out that it
was disinherited, aroused itself in full strength, within and without,
<i>against the Lord and against His Anointed</i>.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> Moreover, Niall,
seeing that flight was inevitable,<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> took with him certain insignia
of that see, to wit, the copy of the Gospels, which had belonged to
blessed Patrick,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> and the staff covered with gold and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>adorned with
most costly gems, which they call "the staff of Jesus," because the Lord
himself (as report affirms) held it in His hands and fashioned it;<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a>
which are deemed of the highest honour and sanctity in that nation. They
are, in fact, very well known and celebrated among the tribes, and so
revered by all, that he who is once seen to have them is held by the
<i>foolish and unwise <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>people</i><a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> to be their bishop. That man&mdash;a
vagabond<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> and another <i>Satan</i>&mdash;<i>went to and fro in the land and
walked up and down in it</i>,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> bearing round the holy insignia; and,
displaying them everywhere, he was for their sake everywhere received,
by them winning the minds of all to himself, and withdrawing as many as
he could from Malachy. These things did he.</p>

<p>25. But there was a certain prince, of the more powerful of the
unrighteous race,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> whom the king before he left the city, had
compelled to swear that he would maintain peace with the bishop, taking
from him, moreover, many hostages. Notwithstanding this, when the king
left he entered the city, and took <i>counsel</i> with his kinsmen and
friends <i>how they might take</i> the holy man <i>by subtlety and kill him;
but they feared the people</i>;<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> and having conspired to slay
Malachy<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> they fixed a place and day, and a traitor <i>gave them a
sign</i>.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> On that very day, when the prelate was now celebrating the
solemnity of Vespers in the church with the whole of the clergy and a
multitude of the people, that worthless man sent him a message in <i>words
of peace with subtlety</i>,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> asking him that he would deign to come
down to him, so that he might make peace. The bystanders answered that
he should rather come to the bishop, and that the church was a more
suitable place for establishing peace; for they foresaw guile. The
messengers replied that this was not safe <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>for the prince; that he
feared for his head, and that he did not trust himself to the crowds
who, some days before, had nearly killed him for the bishop's sake. As
they were contending in this way, these saying that he should go, those
that he should not go, the bishop, desiring peace and not afraid to die,
said, "Brethren, let me imitate my Master.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> I am a Christian to no
purpose if I do not <i>follow</i> Christ.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> Perhaps by humility I shall
bend the tyrant; if not, yet I shall conquer by rendering, a shepherd to
a sheep, a priest to a layman, that duty which he owed to me. You also,
as far as in me lies, I shall edify not a little by such an example. For
what if I should chance to be killed? <i>I refuse not to die</i>,<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> in
order that from me you may have an example of life. It behoves a bishop,
as the prince of bishops says, not <i>to be lord over the clergy, but to
become an example to the flock</i><a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">448</a>&mdash;no other example<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> truly than
that which we have received from Him <i>who humbled himself and became
obedient unto death</i>.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> Who will give me [the opportunity] to leave
this [example] to [my] sons, sealed with my blood? Try, at any rate,
whether your priest has worthily learnt from Christ not to fear death
for Christ." And he arose and went his way, all weeping, and praying
that he would not so greatly desire to die for Christ that he should
leave desolate so great a flock of Christ.</p>

<p>26. (17). But as for him, <i>setting his whole hope</i> in the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> he
went with all speed accompanied only by three disciples who were <i>ready
to die with him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> <i>When he crossed the threshold</i><a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> of the house
and suddenly came <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>into the midst of the armed men&mdash;himself protected by
the <i>shield of faith</i><a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">454</a>&mdash;the <i>countenances</i> of them all <i>fell</i>,<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>
for <i>dread fell upon them</i>,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> so that the bishop could say, <i>Mine

true</i>.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> You might see the victim standing, the slaughterers
surrounding him on all sides, with weapons in their hands; and there was
none to sacrifice him. You might suppose their arms were benumbed; for
there was none to stretch out a hand. For even that one also, who seemed
to be the head of the evil, rose up, not to assail him but to show him
reverence. Where is the sign, O man, which you had given for the death
of the pontiff? This is a sign rather of honour than death; this

<p>27. These matters so accomplished, the bishop now began to dispose and
order in the city all things pertaining to his ministry with entire
freedom, but not without constant risk of his life. For though there was
no one now who would harm him openly, yet the bishop had no place that
was safe from plotters, and no time when he could be at ease; and armed
men were appointed to guard him day and night, though he rather <i>trusted
in the Lord</i>.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> But his purpose was to take action against the
schismatic already mentioned, forasmuch as he was seducing many by means
of the insignia which he carried about, persuading all that he ought to
be bishop, and so stirring up the congregations<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> against Malachy and
the unity of the church.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> And thus he did; and without difficulty in

but also those who disparaged him. A certain man, for example, who was
in favour with the princes and magnates, and even with the king
himself,<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> because he was a flatterer and garrulous and <i>mighty in
tongue</i>,<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> befriended Malachy's opponents in all things, and
impudently maintained their contention. On the other hand, when the
saint was present, he <i>withstood him to the face</i>,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> and when he was
absent he disparaged him. Moreover he accosted him rudely everywhere,
and especially when he knew that he was engaged in the more frequented
assemblies. But he was soon visited with a suitable reward of his
impudent tongue. The evil-speaking tongue swelled, and <i>became putrid
and worms swarmed</i> from it<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> and filled the whole blasphemous mouth.
He vomited them forth incessantly for well-nigh seven days, and at
length with them spued out his wretched soul.</p>

<p>29. Once when Malachy was speaking before the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>people and exhorting
them, a certain unhappy woman dared to interrupt his discourse with evil
cries, showing no respect to the priest <i>and the Spirit which
spake</i>.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> Now she was of the impious race; and having <i>breath in her
nostrils</i><a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> she vomited out blasphemies and insults against the
saint, saying that he was a hypocrite, and an invader of the inheritance
of another, and even reproaching him for his baldness. But he, modest
and gentle as he was, <i>answered</i> her <i>nothing</i>;<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> but the Lord
answered for him. The woman became insane by the judgement of the Lord,
and crying out many times that she was being suffocated by Malachy, at
length by a horrible death she expiated the sin of blasphemy. So this
wretched woman, taking up against Malachy the reproach that had been
made against Elisha,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> found to her cost that he was indeed another
Elisha.</p>

<p>30. Further, because on account of a certain pestilence which arose in
the city, he had solemnly led out a multitude of the clergy and people
with the memorial of the saints,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> neither is this to be passed over,
that when Malachy prayed the pestilence immediately ceased.
Thenceforward there was none to murmur against him, for those who were
of the <i>seed of Canaan<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> said, Let us flee from the face of</i> Malachy,

<p>31. (19). So then Malachy, when within three years<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> <i>a reward was

barbarism driven out and the customs of the Christian religion
everywhere instituted anew, seeing that all things were at peace, began
to think also of his own peace. And mindful of his design <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>he appointed
in his own place Gelasius,<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">492</a> a good man, and worthy of so great an
honour, the clergy and people tacitly assenting, or rather supporting
him because of the agreement.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> For apart from that it seemed
altogether cruel. And when he had been consecrated and earnestly
commended to the kings and princes, Malachy himself, renowned for
miracles and triumphs, returned to his parish;<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> but not to Connor.
Hear the cause, which is worth relating. It is said that that diocese in
ancient times had two episcopal sees, and that there were two
bishoprics; an arrangement which seemed to Malachy preferable to the
existing one. Hence those bishoprics which ambition had welded into
one,<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> Malachy divided again into two, yielding one part to another
bishop and retaining the other for himself. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>And for this reason he did
not come to Connor, because he had already ordained a bishop in it;<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">496</a>
but he betook himself to Down, separating the parishes <i>as in the days
of old</i>.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> O pure heart! O dove-like eye!<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> He handed over to the
new bishop the place which seemed better organized, which was held to be
more important, the place in which he himself had sat. Where are they
that fight about boundaries, carrying on perpetual hostilities against
one another for a single village? I know not if there is any class of
men whom that ancient prophecy touches more than those: <i>They have
ripped up the women with child of Gilead that they might enlarge their
border.</i><a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> But this at another place.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a></p>

<p>32. When Malachy was made bishop of Down, immediately according to his
custom he was at pains to take to himself from his sons, for his
comfort, a convent of regular clerics.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> And lo, again he girds
himself, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>as though a new recruit of Christ, for the spiritual conflict;
again he puts on the <i>weapons</i> that are <i>mighty through God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> the
humility of holy poverty, the rigour of monastic discipline, the
quietness of contemplation, continuance in prayer. But all these things
for a long time he was able to maintain rather in will than in deed. For
all men came to him; not only obscure persons, but also nobles and
magnates, hastened to commit themselves to his wisdom and holiness for
instruction and correction. And he himself meanwhile went about; <i>he
went out to sow his seed</i>,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> disposing and decreeing with all
authority concerning ecclesiastical affairs, like one of the Apostles.
And none <i>said unto him, By what authority doest thou these
things</i>?<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> inasmuch as all <i>saw the miracles</i> and wonders <i>which</i> he
did,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> and because <i>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is

been unusual. But in 1124 Malachy had in this way been appointed abbot
of Bangor (&sect; 12); and in 1134 Murtough designated Niall as his successor
in the abbacy of Armagh (&sect; 22).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_369_369" id="Footnote_369_369"></a><a href="#FNanchor_369_369"><span class="label">[369]</span></a> Conor O'Brien, king of Thomond, and Cormac Mac Carthy,
king of Desmond. See &sect; 9, and p. 21, notes 1-3. Murtough O'Brien, king
of Munster, fell into ill-health in 1114, and his brother Dermot
attempted, evidently with some success, to seize the throne. Dermot died
in 1118 and Murtough early in the following year. Turlough O'Conor, the
powerful king of Connaught, promptly invaded Munster, and divided it
into two vassal kingdoms, Thomond and Desmond. The former he gave to the
sons of Dermot, of whom Conor was one, the latter to Teague Mac Carthy.
Apparently Conor O'Brien soon established himself as sole king of
Thomond, and Cormac Mac Carthy became king of Desmond on the death of
his father, Teague, in 1124. We have seen that both of them were deposed
in 1127, and quickly restored (&sect; 9 f.: see p. 21, n. 3; p. 23, n. 2).
From that time Conor and Cormac were allies. Cormac married Conor's
niece (<i>A.T.</i> 1138). Together in 1133 they invaded Connaught (<i>A.F.M.</i>),
and the next year they made another successful expedition through
Connaught into Ulster (then ruled by Conor O'Loughlin; see p. 40, n. 2),
in the course of which they burned the church of Rathluraigh, now
Maghera, co. Derry, near the border of the diocese of Armagh (<i>D.A.I.</i>).
This expedition must be referred to hereafter (p. 51, n. 2). But Conor
evidently aspired to be <i>ardr&iacute;</i> of Ireland, and he found it desirable to
remove a possible rival. Accordingly Cormac was murdered by his
father-in-law, Conor's brother, in 1138, and Conor became king of all
Munster. He was now the most powerful prince in Ireland; but he died,
after a lingering illness (Tundale, p. 42), in 1142, without attaining
his ambition.
</p><p>
It is clear from the present passage that Conor O'Brien followed in the
footsteps of his predecessors in the same family as a supporter of the
new movement in the Irish Church. Cormac, as we know, was the friend and
disciple of Malachy: his devotion to the Church is witnessed to by the
beautiful edifice built by him at Cashel, still known as "Cormac's
Chapel," which was consecrated in 1134; and by his title of
"Bishop-King," which has been the subject of so much discussion. See
Petrie, pp. 283-307; and for the crozier found in Cormac's supposed
tomb, G. Coffey, <i>Guide to the Celtic Antiquities of the Christian
Period in the National Museum, Dublin</i>, p. 64. But it must be added that
the contemporary Vision of Tundale, which apparently emanated from
Cormac's kingdom of Desmond, while bearing emphatic testimony to his
generosity to "Christ's poor and pilgrims," charges him with heinous
crimes strangely inconsistent with St. Bernard's sketch of his character
(Tundale, p. 44 f.).</p></div>

it is unknown in early Irish ecclesiastical terminology, and in Irish
hierarchical arrangements it would have no meaning. The context proves
that the persons to whom it is here applied are the abbots of Armagh, of
whom Cellach was one. It probably represents a Latin rendering of "coarb
(successor) of Patrick," a title commonly given to the abbots of this
period. The document portrayed the coarbs as rulers of the church of
Armagh. St. Bernard would naturally infer that they were bishops. When
he found that their authority extended beyond Armagh he would no less
naturally style them archbishops or metropolitans. Cp. Serm. i, &sect; 6,

Murtough's election to his death, September 17, 1134 (<i>A.F.M.</i>)&mdash;nearly

latinized form of the Irish <i>Gilla espuig</i> (servant of the bishop),
which is anglicized Gillespie. With that Irish name he subscribed the
Acts of the Synod of Rathbreasail (Keating, iii. 306); and we may
therefore affirm with confidence that he was an Irishman. Gilbert was a
friend of the famous thinker and ecclesiastical statesman, Anselm, who
was archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to 1109. The two men met each
other for the first time at Rouen, probably in 1087, when Anselm was
called thither to the deathbed of William the Conqueror. Twenty years
later, Gilbert, then bishop of Limerick, wrote a letter of
congratulation to Anselm on his victory over Henry I. in the controversy
concerning investiture (August 1107). In his reply Anselm intimates that
the long interval had not blurred his recollection of their former
companionship, from which we may infer that Gilbert's personality had
made a considerable impression upon him. Anselm also states that he had
learned (probably from the superscription of his friend's letter) that
he was now a bishop. It would seem, therefore, that Gilbert had been
consecrated recently, and not, like the contemporary bishops of Danish
sees in Ireland, by the English Primate (see the letters in Ussher, 511,
512). He probably became bishop of Limerick about 1105. Shortly after
his correspondence with Anselm, and perhaps by his influence, he was
appointed papal legate for Ireland, the first, as St. Bernard tells us,
who had held that office. He was legate when in 1108 or 1109 he wrote
his tract <i>De Statu Ecclesi&aelig;</i> (see above, p. xxx. ff.); and in 1110, as
legate, he presided over the Synod of Rathbreasail. In 1139 or 1140,
being old and infirm, he resigned his legatine commission and his see (&sect;
38 and p. 73, note 1). He died in 1145. Gilbert was evidently a strong
man, who had much influence on the affairs of the Irish Church. It is
therefore surprising that the only reference to him in the native Annals
is the notice of his death in the <i>Chronicon Scotorum</i>.</p></div>

by the Annals under the year 1134. <i>A.F.M.</i>, after recording the obit of
Murtough, proceed: "Niall, son of Aedh, was installed in the coarbate of
Patrick. A change of abbots in Armagh, <i>i.e.</i> Mael Maedoc Ua Morgair in
place of Niall." In <i>A.T.</i> we have the statement, "Mael Maedog o Mongair
ascended Patrick's chair. The Cinel Eoghain of Tulach &Oacute;g conspired
against Mael Maedoc, and a flash of lightning consumed twelve men of
them on the spot where they conspired against him." Thus it seems that
the conspirators came from the place now known as Tullaghoge, in the
county of Tyrone, then, as now, in the diocese of Armagh. It was the
district inhabited by the sept of the O'Hagans, and in it was the <i>l&iacute;a
na r&iacute;gh</i>, the inauguration chair of the O'Neills, kings of Ulster. The
confirmation which St. Bernard's story receives from <i>A.T.</i> is the more
important, because the two narratives are so far different that they
must have come from independent sources.</p></div>

cause of St. Bernard's error; for one of his documents may, like

was absent on a visitation of Munster, mentioned in <i>A.F.M.</i>, but
apparently unknown to St. Bernard. The statement of the latter, that
Malachy "remained" in Armagh, ignores it. See further, Additional Note

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_435_435" id="Footnote_435_435"></a><a href="#FNanchor_435_435"><span class="label">[435]</span></a> The <i>Book of Armagh</i>, now in the Library of Trinity
College, Dublin. The manuscript was written at Armagh early in the ninth
century by a scribe named Ferdomnach; but at an early date it came to be
supposed that it was the work of St. Patrick himself. From this belief,
perhaps, arose the name by which it was known for many centuries, and
which can be traced back to the year 936&mdash;the Canon of Patrick. It is
strange that it should be called here a "copy of the Gospels"; for in
addition to the complete text of the New Testament it contains two lives
of St. Patrick, his <i>Confession</i> and other historical documents. But the
word <i>Gospel</i> was very loosely used in Ireland (see <i>R.I.A.</i> xxxiii. 327
f.). Misled by this description, de Backer (n. <i>ad loc.</i>) identifies the
book mentioned by St. Bernard with the so-called "Gospels of St.
Patrick," found in the shrine known as the Domnach Airgid, about 1830,
which have no connexion with Armagh or St. Patrick (<i>R.I.A. Trans.</i>
xviii., "Antiquities," pp. 14 ff.; xxx. 303 ff.; <i>R.I.A.</i> xxxiv. 108
ff.). For further information about the <i>Book of Armagh</i> the reader may
consult Gwynn, especially pp. ci.-cxvi.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_436_436" id="Footnote_436_436"></a><a href="#FNanchor_436_436"><span class="label">[436]</span></a> The staff of Jesus was a wooden crozier (Giraldus, <i>Top.</i>
iii. 34), richly adorned. The story of its presentation by Christ to St.
Patrick is found in the tenth-century <i>Trip.</i> (p. 30), no doubt taken
from an earlier source. The staff was much older than the <i>Book of
Armagh</i>; for we find that it was "profaned" in 789, and it was then
apparently regarded as the principal relic of St. Patrick (<i>A.U.</i> 788).
It seems that there was a still more ancient tradition, that St. Patrick
gave it to St. Mac Cairthinn (<i>R.I.A.</i> xxxiv. 114), from which it may be
inferred that it once belonged to the church of Clogher. It was removed
from Armagh to Dublin in 1180, and deposited in Christ Church. It was
burnt in 1538 (<i>A.L.C.</i>). Apparently St. Bernard is the only authority
for the statement that it was "fashioned" by Christ. It appears that the
staff of Jesus, in the twelfth century, was regarded as a much more
important relic than the <i>Book of Armagh</i>, and was more closely
associated with the person and office of the coarb of Patrick. It is
frequently mentioned in such a way as to suggest that it was one of the
insignia of his authority (<i>A.U.</i> 1015, 1073, 1101, 1113, 1157, 1166,
1167; <i>A.F.M.</i> 1135, 1139, 1143, 1148, 1152). Similar references to the
<i>Book of Armagh</i> do not occur till near the close of the twelfth
century, immediately after the removal of the staff from Armagh (<i>A.U.</i>
1179, 1196; Gwynn, p. civ.). A very full account of the later history of
the staff may be read in <i>O.C.C.</i> pp. viii-xx.</p></div>

establishing peace in the latter years of his rule at Armagh may be
attributed in part to the influence of a prince who is not mentioned in
the text. Donough O'Carroll first appears in the Annals as chieftain of
the men of Fearnmaigh (now represented by the barony of Farney, co.
Monaghan), whom he led in an expedition against Fingal (the district
north of Dublin) in 1133. He seems to have succeeded to the kingdom or
lordship of Oriel (which included the present counties of Armagh,
Monaghan and Louth) on the death of Conor O'Loughlin (May 1136); for in
1138, "with the Oirgialla," he took part in an invasion of Meath. His
career was prosperous till 1152, when he assaulted the coarb of Patrick
(Gelasius). In consequence he was attacked by the Cen&eacute;l Eoghain, and
expelled from Oriel. In 1155 he was imprisoned by Tighernan O'Rorke in
Lough Sheelan, for six weeks; but he escaped and recovered his kingdom,
and was present at the consecration of the Church of Mellifont Abbey in
1157. He was murdered in 1168. For his support of Malachy see Additional

reckoned from the death of Murtough (September 17, 1134), or from the
subsequent ejection of Niall. Since stress is laid on the shortness,
rather than the length of the period, we may therefore conclude that
peace was established not long before October 1137, or, at any rate,
after the beginning of that year. And as St. Bernard believed that the
inauguration of Gelasius "immediately" followed the resignation of
Malachy, we may gather that both these events took place in 1137.

of a Tyrone sept, named Dermot (O'Hanlon, <i>Saints</i>, iii. 965). About
1121 he was appointed abbot of Derry, and held that office till he
became archbishop of Armagh in 1137. He had a long episcopate and seems
to have been a vigorous prelate. His age and infirmity (says Giraldus)
prevented him from attending the Synod of Cashel in 1172. But he
subsequently visited Henry II. in Dublin. Thither he brought the white
cow, whose milk was his only food (Giraldus, <i>Expug.</i> i. 35). He died
March 27, 1174, in his eighty-seventh year. For a Life of Gelasius, see

in early time there were many more sees than two in that district (see
Reeves, p. 138), and there is no evidence that any one of them was the
seat of a diocesan bishop. But, even if it were so, St. Bernard's
statement that the two supposed dioceses were "welded into one" by some
ambitious prelate prior to Malachy is unhistorical. A bishop of Connor
and a bishop of Down both died in 1117, just seven years before Malachy
became bishop of the diocese which included these two places; and there
is no trace of a bishop in either of them in the interval. The fact
seems to be that the diocese of Connor or Down was constituted for the
first time at the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1110. It remained on paper
until Malachy was appointed its first bishop. For the probable reason of
Malachy's division of the diocese, see p. lvii. f.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_496_496" id="Footnote_496_496"></a><a href="#FNanchor_496_496"><span class="label">[496]</span></a> This cannot be the true reason for Malachy's choice of
Down rather than Connor. If he had wished to go to Connor on his
retirement from Armagh he could have consecrated a bishop for Down. It
is more probable that his preference was due to his love for Bangor,
where he resided during his first episcopate, and where he probably
resided also when he was bishop of Down. But, however that may be,
Bangor was necessarily under his jurisdiction as bishop of Down; his
connexion with it would have been severed if he had assumed the
oversight of the new diocese of Connor.</p></div>

convent&mdash;which obviously consisted of Augustinian canons (the only order
of regular clerics recognized at this period by the Roman Church: see
Conc. Lat. 1139, can. 9, Mansi xxi. 528)&mdash;was in Downpatrick. It has
accordingly been identified with a monastery which in the Terrier of
1615 is described as "the monastery of the Irish, hard by the
Cathedral," and called "the church of the channons" (Reeves, 43, 231).
But it is not stated in the text to have been in Down. It seems more
likely to have been the monastery of Bangor, which was destroyed in 1127
(&sect; 18), and must have been reconstituted about this time. There is no
indication in the <i>Life</i> that Malachy resided in Down, while there are
several hints that Bangor was his headquarters and that he was abbot of
the community there as long as he lived. (See p. 33, n. 1.) In other
words Bangor was, in fact if not in name, the see of the diocese of
Ulaid, or Down. For this curious anomaly we have a parallel in the
diocese of T&iacute;r Eoghain, the see of which for a long period was at
Maghera, the bishop, the while, being often styled bishop of Derry
(<i>Irish Church Quarterly</i>, x. 225 ff.); and for the bishop of a diocese
serving as abbot of his cathedral chapter of regular canons we may point
to Carlisle (<i>Trans. of Scottish Ecclesiological Society</i>, iii. 267
ff.), Louth (<i>L.A.J.</i> iv. 143 ff.) and Christ Church, Dublin (<i>ibid.</i>
145). That the canons of Bangor were at an early period the bishop's
chapter we have independent evidence. For in 1244 the Pope gave
judgement in a cause which had been pending for some time between the
prior and monks of Down and the abbot and canons of Bangor, each of whom
claimed that their church was cathedral (Theiner, p. 42). This claim on
behalf of Bangor is easily explained if it was reckoned as the bishop's
see in the time of Malachy.</p></div>

and rendered a parting from Malachy more grievous. They said, in fact,
that they would in no wise assent to the pilgrimage of their only
protector, since <i>the whole land</i> would <i>be made desolate</i><a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> if in
one moment it was bereaved of two such <i>pillars</i>.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> Therefore all,
with one voice, opposed him, and would have used force but that he
threatened them with divine vengeance. They refused to desist, however,
till the will of God on this matter should be asked by the casting of a
lot. He forbade it: nevertheless they cast the lot, but thrice it was
found to give an answer in favour of Malachy. For they were not content
with one trial, so eager were they to retain him. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Yielding at length
they let him go, but not without <i>lamentation and weeping and great
mourning</i>.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> But that he should leave nothing imperfect he began to
take measures by which he might <i>raise up the seed of his</i> dead
<i>brother</i>.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">516</a> And three of his disciples having been summoned to him
he deliberated anxiously which should seem more worthy, or, in other
words, more useful, for this work. <span class="sidenote">1140, January</span>And when he had scrutinized them one
by one, he said, "Do you, Edan" (that was the name of one of them),
"undertake the burden."<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> And when he hesitated and wept, he
proceeded, "Do not fear; for you have been designated to me by the Lord;
for just now I saw in anticipation the gold ring with which you are to
be espoused on your finger."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> He assented, and when he had been
consecrated Malachy set out on his journey.</p>

<p>35. And when he had left Scotland<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> and reached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>York, a priest,
named Sycarus,<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> <i>steadfastly beholding him</i><a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> recognized him. For
though he had not seen his face before, because he <i>had the spirit of
prophecy</i><a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> he had received a revelation concerning him long ago. And
now without hesitation he pointed him out with his finger to those who
stood round him, saying, "<i>This is he of whom I had said</i> that from
Ireland <i>there shall come</i><a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> a holy bishop who <i>knoweth the thoughts
of man</i>."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> So the <i>lamp</i> could not be hid <i>under a bushel</i>, for the
Holy Spirit who <i>lighted</i> it<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> brought it forth by the mouth of
Sycarus. For also many secret things concerning the affairs of him and
his companions were told him by Sycarus, all of which he acknowledged to
be or to have been. But when the companions of Malachy went on to
inquire about their return, Sycarus immediately replied&mdash;and <i>the event
afterwards proved the truth of the saying</i><a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">526</a>&mdash;that evidently very few
of their number would return with the bishop. When they heard that they
imagined that he apprehended death: but God fulfilled it in another way;
for on his way back from the City he left some with us, and some in
other places, to learn the rule of life;<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">527</a> and so, <i>according to the
word</i> of Sycarus,<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">528</a> he returned to his own country with very few
companions. So much concerning Sycarus.</p>

<p>36. In the same city of York he was visited by a man of noble rank
according to the standard of the world, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>Waltheof<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> by name, then
prior of the regular brothers at Kirkham,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> but now a monk, and
father of the monks at Melrose, a monastery of our Order,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> who
devoutly commended himself with humility to Malachy's prayers. And when
he noticed that the bishop had many companions and few horses&mdash;for
besides ministers<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> and other clerks he had with him five presbyters,
and only three horses&mdash;he offered him his own, on which he rode, saying
that he regretted only one thing, that it was a pack-horse<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">533</a> and a
rough animal to ride. And <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>he added, "I would have given it more
willingly if it had been better; but, if you think it worth while, take
it with you, such as it is." "And I," replied the bishop, "accept it the
more willingly the more valueless you proclaim it, because nothing can
be of no value to me which so precious a will offers;" and, turning to
his companions, "Saddle this horse for me, for it is suitable for me,
and will suffice for a long time." This done, he mounts. And at first he
considered it rough, as it was, but afterwards, by a wonderful change,
he found that it suited him well and ambled pleasantly. And that there
might not <i>fall</i> on <i>the ground</i> any part of the word which he had
spoken,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> till the ninth year, the year in which he died,<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> it did
not fail him, and became an excellent and very valuable palfrey.
And&mdash;that which made the miracle more evident to those that saw&mdash;from
being nearly black it began to grow white, and after no long time<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">536</a>
there was scarcely a whiter horse to be found than it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1140, March</div>

<p>37. (21). To me also it was granted to see the man on that journey,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">537</a>
and by the sight of him and by his word <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>I was refreshed, and <i>I
rejoiced as in all riches</i>;<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> and I, in turn, though a sinner, <i>found
grace in his sight</i><a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> then, and from that time up to his death, as I
said in the Preface.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> He also, deigning to turn aside to
Clairvaux,<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">541</a> when he saw the brothers was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>deeply moved; and they
were not a little edified by his presence and his speech. So accepting
the place and us, and gathering us into his inmost heart, he bade us
farewell and departed. And crossing the Alps he came to Ivrea,<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> a
city of Italy, where he immediately healed the little son of his host
who <i>was sick and ready to die</i>.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">543</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1140, May</div>

<p>38. Pope Innocent II., of happy memory, was then in the Apostolic
See.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a> He received him courteously, and displayed kindly pity for him
on account of his long pilgrimage. And Malachy in the first place asked
with many tears for that which he had fixed most deeply in his heart,
that he might be allowed to live and die at Clairvaux, with the
permission and blessing of the chief Pontiff. He sought this, not
forgetful of the purpose for which he had come, but influenced by the
longing for Clairvaux which he had brought with him.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> But he did not
obtain his request, because the apostolic man decided that he should be
employed to more profitable advantage. He was not, however, wholly
disappointed of <i>his heart's desire</i>,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">546</a> since it was granted him if
not to live, at least to die there. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>He spent a whole month in the City,
visiting the holy places and resorting to them for prayer. During that
time the chief Pontiff made frequent and careful inquiry of him and
those who were with him concerning the affairs of their country, the
morals of the people, the state of the churches, and the great things
that God had wrought by him in the land. And when he was already
preparing to return home the Pope committed his own authority to him,
appointing him legate throughout the whole of Ireland. For Bishop
Gilbert, who, as we have mentioned above, was then legate, had intimated
to him that by reason of age and infirmity of body <i>he could no longer
discharge the duties of the office</i>.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> After this Malachy prayed that
the constitution of the new metropolis<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> should be confirmed, and
that palls should be given him for both sees. The privilege of
confirmation he soon received; "but regarding the palls," said the chief
Pontiff, "more formal action must be taken. You must call together the
bishops and clerks and the magnates of the land and hold a general
council; and so with the assent and common desire of all ye shall demand
the pall by persons of honest repute, and it shall be given you." Then
he took his mitre from his own head, and placed it on Malachy's
head,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> and more, he gave him the stole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>and maniple which he was
accustomed to use in the offering; and saluting him with the kiss of
peace he dismissed him, strengthened with the apostolic blessing and
authority.</p>

<p>39. And returning by Clairvaux he bestowed on us <i>a second</i>
benediction.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">550</a> And sighing deeply that it was not allowed him to
remain as he longed to do, he said, "Meanwhile I pray you to keep these
men for me, that they may learn from you what they may afterwards teach
us." And he added, "They will be to us for a seed, <i>and in</i> this <i>seed
shall the nations be blessed</i>,<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> even those nations which from
ancient days have heard the name of monk, but have not seen a
monk."<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> And leaving four of his most intimate companions<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> he
departed: and they, when <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>they were proved and found worthy, were made
monks. After a time, when the saint was now in his own country, he sent
others,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> and they were dealt with in like manner. And when they had
been instructed for some time <i>and had applied their hearts unto<span class="sidenote">1142</span>
wisdom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> the holy brother Christian,<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">556</a> who was one of
themselves, was given to them to be their father, and we sent them out,
adding from our own a sufficient number for an abbey.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">557</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>And this
abbey <i>conceived and bare</i> five <i>daughters</i>,<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> and the seed being
thus multiplied<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> the number of monks increases from day to day
according to the desire and prophecy of Malachy. Now let us return to
the order of the narrative.</p>

<p>40. (22). Malachy having set out from us had a prosperous journey
through Scotland. And he found King David,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> who is still alive
to-day, in one of his castles;<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">561</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>and his son <i>was sick nigh unto
death</i>.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> And when Malachy entered the king's house he was honourably
received by him and prevailed upon by humble entreaty <i>that he would
heal his son</i>.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> He sprinkled the youth with water which he had
blessed, and <i>fastening his eyes upon him</i> said,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> "Trust me, my son;
you shall not die this time." He said this, and on the next day,
according to his word, there followed the cure, and after the cure the
joy of the father and the shouting and noise of the whole exulting
family. The <i>rumour went forth</i><a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">565</a> to all, for what happened in the
royal house and to the king's son <i>could not be hid</i>.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> And lo,
everywhere there resounded <i>thanksgiving and the voice of praise</i>,<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">567</a>
both for the salvation of their lord, and for the novelty of the
miracle. This is Henry;<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">568</a> for he still lives, the only son of his
father, a brave and prudent knight, taking after his father as they say,
in <i>following after righteousness</i><a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">569</a> and love of the truth. And both
loved Malachy, as long as he lived, because he had recalled him from
death. They asked him to remain some days; but he, shunning renown, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>was
impatient of delay, and in the morning went on his way.</p>

<p>As he passed, therefore, through the village called Cruggleton,<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> a
dumb girl met him. While he prayed <i>the string of her tongue was loosed
and she spake plain</i>.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">571</a></p>

<p>Then he entered the village which they call St. Michael's Church,<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">572</a>
and before all the people cured a woman who was brought to him, mad and
bound with cords; and when he had sent her away restored he went on.</p>

<p>But when he came to Portus Lapasperi,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">573</a> he waited there for a passage
some days; but the time of delay <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>did not pass idly. In the interval an
oratory is constructed of twigs woven into a hedge, he both giving
directions and himself working. When it was finished he surrounded it
with a wall, and blessed the enclosed space for a cemetery. The merits
of him who blessed, the miracles, which are said to be wrought there
frequently to this day, sufficiently declare.</p>

<p>41. Hence it came that they were in the habit of carrying thither from
the neighbouring places those <i>that were</i> infirm and <i>diseased</i>, and
<i>many</i> were healed.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> A woman paralysed in all her limbs, brought
thither on a waggon, returned home on foot, having waited only one night
in the holy place, not in vain, for the mercy of the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></p>

<p>Let these incidents&mdash;a few out of many&mdash;suffice with reference to that
place; for now we must proceed with what remains.</p>

every metropolitan is required to obtain from the Pope, and without
which he cannot exercise his functions. From the end of the eleventh
century it has been described in papal bulls as the symbol of "the
fullness of the pontifical office" (<i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, xi. 428).

bishop of that diocese in succession to Cinaeth Ua Baigill, who died in
1135 (<i>A.T.</i>). He seems to have transferred the see of the diocese to
Louth, a large part of the diocese of Armagh (in which Louth was
situated) being placed under his jurisdiction. This arrangement was no
doubt made by Malachy with the support of Donough O'Carroll. See the
document quoted in Additional Note C, p. 170, <i>L.A.J.</i> iv. 133 ff. and
above, p. lix. Christian is commemorated in the contemporary Martyrology
of Gorman on June 12. The year of his death is stated (<i>A.F.M.</i>) to have
been 1138. St. Bernard obviously supposed it to have taken place in 1139
(p. 70, n. 2), and he appears to be right. For the work described in &sect;
32 demands a longer period than can be allowed for it on the supposition
that he divulged his scheme of visiting Rome before June 12, 1138.
Moreover by that time he cannot have known that the papal schism had
come to an end; for the Anti-pope did not submit till May 29. Cp. p. 72,
n. 3, and <i>R.I.A.</i> xxxv. 245 ff. For another notice of Christian, see p.

(<i>A.L.C.</i>). He organized the diocese of Oriel, with its see at
Louth&mdash;corresponding to the present diocese of Clogher&mdash;by the help of
Donough O'Carroll. In conjunction with him he founded the monastery of
SS. Peter and Paul for Augustinian canons at Knock, by Louth,
consecrated by Malachy in 1148 (<i>A.F.M.</i>; <i>L.A.J.</i> iv. 239, and document
quoted, p. 170). Close to it he also founded the Augustinian monastery
of St. Mary, the church of which was the cathedral church of the
diocese. On the early history of this diocese see <i>L.A.J.</i> iv. 129 ff.</p></div>

in a medieval register of Clogher we read that when Edan had anointed
Christian on his deathbed "Malachy saw the ring which Christian wore
leap to Edan's finger, and therefore he consecrated him bishop"
(<i>L.A.J.</i> iv. 239).</p></div>

But Malachy probably sailed from Bangor to Cairngarroch (&sect; 40, p. 78, n.

The kingdom of Scotland then extended southwards to the river Ribble at
Gisburn (&sect; 69) and eastwards to the Tees (William of Newburgh, in

<i>Walleuus</i> (<i>Wallevus</i>), which is the reading of A. The name occurs also
in the form Waldeve. St. Waltheof was the younger son of Simon de St.
Liz, earl of Northampton, by his wife Matilda, daughter of Waltheof,
earl of Northumberland. After Simon's death Matilda married David,
afterwards (1124) king of Scots. That Waltheof was the stepson of David
I. is a fact not unimportant for readers of the <i>Life of St. Malachy</i>.
After living for some time in Scotland Waltheof retired to the
Augustinian priory of St. Oswald, Nostal. Subsequently, but at what date
seems to be unknown, he was appointed prior of Kirkham. But, desirous of
a more austere life, he resigned the priory, and entered a Cistercian
house at Wardon, Bedfordshire. From it he soon migrated to Rievaulx in
Yorkshire, and took the vows of the Order. On the deposition of Richard,
first abbot of Melrose, he was elected as his successor in 1148. He died
August 3, 1159. (Life by Jocelin in <i>AA.SS.</i>, Aug, i. 248). His visit to
Malachy proves that the fame of the latter had come to his
ears&mdash;probably through the Scots who knew him at Lismore (&sect; 8). It
indicates also that Malachy stayed at York long enough to allow the news
of his arrival to be sent to Kirkham.</p></div>

approximately the line of the Roman road known as Erming Street to
London and Canterbury. Thanks to the preservation of the Itinerary of
Archbishop Sigeric on his journey from Rome to Canterbury in 990
(Stubbs, <i>Memorials of St. Dunstan</i> (R.S.), pp. 391-395), to our
knowledge of the routes of travellers contemporary with Malachy, and to
the rare mention in the <i>Life</i> of places through which he passed, we can
follow him almost step by step from Canterbury to Rome and back. He
probably sailed from Dover, and landed on the French coast at or near
Wissant. Thence he went by Arras, Rheims, Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne,
Bar-sur-Aube, Lausanne, Martigny, and over the Great St. Bernard to
Ivrea. Then he followed the beaten tract through Vercelli, Pavia,
Piacenza, Pontremoli, Lucca and Viterbo to Rome. On the whole journey,
from Bangor to Rome and back, the company traversed about 3000 miles on
land, besides crossing the sea four times. Allowing for stoppages at
Rome, Clairvaux and elsewhere, and for a weekly rest on Sunday, Malachy
must have been absent from Ireland about nine months. For details see
<i>R.I.A.</i> xxxv. 238 ff. The marginal dates are based on that
investigation, and are to be regarded merely as approximations.</p></div>

Bar-sur-Aube, from which Clairvaux is distant eight miles. A few words
may be said about this famous monastery and its first abbot. Bernard,
the son of a nobleman named Tescelin and his saintly wife Aleth, whose
memory exercised a powerful influence on the lives of her children, was
born at Fontaines, a mile or two from Dijon, in 1090. In Oct. 1111 he
persuaded his brothers and many of his friends to embrace the religious
life. Early in the following year the whole band, thirty in number,
entered the austere and now declining community which had been
established in 1098 at Citeaux, twelve miles from Dijon. Their arrival
was the beginning of the prosperity of the great Cistercian Order. In
1115 Bernard was sent out, with some brothers, by the abbot, Stephen
Harding, to found a daughter house on the river Aube, in a valley which
had once been known, from its desolation, as the Valley of Wormwood.
After incredible hardships a monastery was built, and the place was so
transformed by the labours of the monks that henceforth it deserved its
newer name of Clara Vallis, or Clairvaux. The community rapidly
increased in numbers; and in 1133, in spite of the opposition of the
abbot when the proposal was first made, the building of a large
monastery on a different site was begun. It was probably far advanced
when Malachy arrived in 1140 (Vacandard, i. 413, 423). It was just
completed when he came again in 1148 (see p. 143, n. 5). St. Bernard
died on August 20, 1153. At this time he was the most powerful
ecclesiastic in Europe, not excepting his nominee Pope Innocent II. (see
p. 72, n. 3). Doubtless the main purpose of Malachy's visit to Clairvaux
was to secure St. Bernard's support of the petition which he was about
to present to the Pope. For further information about St. Bernard the
reader may consult <i>V.P.</i>, Vacandard, J. Cotter Morison, <i>The Life and
Times of St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux</i> (1868), and Richard S. Storrs,
<i>Bernard of Clairvaux, the Times, the Man, and his Work</i> (1892).</p></div>

Popes were elected by different groups of cardinals, Innocent II. and
Anacletus II. St. Bernard espoused the cause of the former, and by his
untiring efforts almost all the sovereigns of Europe were enlisted on
his side (see Vacandard, chaps. x.-xiii., xviii.; Storrs, pp. 523-540;
Morison, pp. 149-165, 209-213). But the schism lasted for eight years.
At length Anacletus died (January 7, 1138), and the surrender of his
successor, Victor IV., on May 29, 1138 (<i>Ep.</i> 317), left Innocent in
undisputed occupation of the papal chair. The news of the pacification
was not announced in Scotland till the end of September (Richard of
Hexham, 170). It probably reached Ireland a little later. It must have
been after he was assured of the end of the schism that Malachy proposed
his journey to Rome, <i>i.e.</i> at the end of 1138 or in 1139.</p></div>

Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, who was himself consecrated on
January 8, 1139 (W. Stubbs, <i>Reg. Sac. Angl.</i>, p. 45). His profession of
obedience (Ussher, p. 565) appears in the roll of professions at
Canterbury immediately before that of Uhtred of Llandaff, who was
consecrated in 1140 (Stubbs, <i>l.c.</i>). If we assume that Gilbert resigned
his see and his legatine commission at the same time, this gives 1139-40
as the date of Malachy's journey, in agreement with the hint of St.
Bernard in &sect; 36. It is possible that Gilbert's resignation of his office
as legate was sent to Rome by Malachy.</p></div>

sent from Clairvaux to Sweden in 1143, and had founded a daughter
monastery there: "The lord [St. Bernard] sent to his faithful servant
learned and discreet persons from the parts of Germany and England, by
whom the discipline of monastic religion founded in that kingdom
increased and bore worthy fruit among peoples who had indeed heard the
name of monk, but had never before seen a monk" (<i>V.P.</i> vii. 54). It was
literally true that no monastic communities had previously existed in
Sweden (C. H. Robinson, <i>Conversion of Europe</i>, p. 482 f. Cp. Vacandard,
ii. 416). But the passage before us cannot be construed as an assertion
that Ireland was in like case; for in &sect; 12 mention is made of the
"monks" of Bangor in the time of Congall. St. Bernard (or Malachy, if
the words are really his) must be taken to mean simply that the
so-called monks of the decadent contemporary Church of Ireland were not
monks in the true sense of the word. (Cp. Lett. iii. &sect; 2). There is
nothing to be said for the explanation suggested by Lanigan (iv. 114)
that the "nations" are nations other than the Irish, who had no monks.
For where were those nations to whom the Irish might send colonies of
monks? The fact is that the Latin word for "nations" (<i>gentes</i>) may
quite well mean here what it certainly means in &sect; 42, the Irish tribes.</p></div>

district of Bangor (&sect; 14). He seems to have been one of the four who
were left by Malachy at Clairvaux; and, as is here stated, he was the
first abbot of Mellifont. He seems, however, to have proved not well
suited for the office, for he was sent back to Clairvaux for further
instruction (Letter iii. &sect; 3). Some of the Clairvaux brothers (if not
all of them) refused to remain in Ireland, and it is perhaps hinted that
the cause of their return was dissatisfaction with his administration
(<i>ib.</i> &sect; 2). About 1150 he was promoted to the bishopric of Lismore, and
at the Synod of Kells in 1152 he appeared as papal legate (Keating, iii.
317). He was present at the consecration of the church of Mellifont
Abbey in 1157 (<i>A.U.</i>) As legate he also presided at the Synod of Cashel
in 1172 (Giraldus, <i>Expug.</i> i. 34). He died in 1186 (<i>A.L.C.</i>). Felix,
bishop of Lismore, attended the Lateran Council of 1179 (Mansi, xxii.
217). Christian must therefore have resigned his see before that date.</p></div>

secluded valley, beside the stream known as the Mattock, about two miles
from the Boyne, and five miles west of Drogheda. Some time after Malachy
returned to Ireland he wrote to St. Bernard, asking him to send two of
the four brothers who had been left at Clairvaux to select a site for
the abbey. This request was declined (Lett. i. &sect; 1), and the
site&mdash;doubtless the gift of Donough O'Carroll (see the document quoted
p. 170)&mdash;was apparently chosen by Malachy himself. In 1142 (<i>C.M.A.</i> ii.
262, <i>Clyn's Annals</i>, <i>Annals of Boyle</i>), the four brothers, together
with a contingent of monks from Clairvaux, arrived, and the monastery
was founded, with Christian as its first abbot (Lett. ii.). Considerable
progress was made with the buildings, and endowments poured in. But
after a while it became necessary to send Christian back to France for
further instruction, and the Clairvaux monks went with him, never to
return. In due time Christian resumed his office as abbot, and with him
came one Robert, to assist him in the work of building and organization
(Lett. iii). The Abbey Church was not consecrated till 1157, nine years
after Malachy's death (<i>A.U.</i>). Mellifont remained the principal
Cistercian house in Ireland up to the Reformation. After the dissolution
(1539) it was granted, with its possessions, to Sir Edward Moore,
ancestor of the earls of Drogheda. The only portions of the monastery
which remain in a fair state of preservation are the Chapter House and
the Lavabo. The latter belongs to the original building. Excavations
made about twenty years ago revealed the ground plan of the entire
monastery, most of which was of later date than Malachy. Traces were
discovered of the foundation of the eastern portion of the original
church, about forty feet west of the east wall of the structure which
later took its place. It had six chapels at the east end, four of which
were apsidal (<i>71st Report of Commissioners of Public Works, Ireland</i>,
p. 11).</p></div>

last-named seems to have been in existence in 1148 (see &sect; 64), and it
may have been an off-shoot of Mellifont, though at an early date it was

place; but it appears to have been founded (1150?) after the <i>Life</i> was
written (Janauschek, p. 114).</p></div>

Margaret, the sister of Edgar the Atheling. He was born in 1084. His
sister Matilda was the wife of Henry I. of England; and thus he was
uncle of Matilda, the empress, for whom he fought against Stephen,
though Stephen's wife, Queen Matilda, was also his niece. In 1113 David
married Matilda, the widow of Simon de St. Liz, earl of Northampton (cp.
p. 69, n. 1). He succeeded Alexander I. in 1124 and died in 1153. As the
founder of several Scottish dioceses and as having introduced the
Cistercian Order into his kingdom he had much in common with St.
Malachy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_561_561" id="Footnote_561_561"></a><a href="#FNanchor_561_561"><span class="label">[561]</span></a> This is probably an error. There is no record that David
I. had any castles in Galloway; and the chronicles seem to show that at
this period his principal residences were at Roxburgh and Carlisle. The
narrative suggests that the castle referred to was in the immediate
neighbourhood of Cruggleton (p. 78, n. 1), and it was probably the
predecessor of that of which the scanty ruins&mdash;believed to be of
thirteenth-century date&mdash;remain on the coast not far from the village.
They are on a peninsula of such natural strength that we may suppose it
was in very early times the site of a fortress (<i>Fourth Report of
Commission on Ancient Monuments in Scotland</i>, vol. i. p. 144). Possibly,
as has been suggested, David was there as the guest of Fergus, lord of
Galloway (1124-1161), to whom, subsequently to the Battle of the
Standard (August 22, 1138), and probably not long before this visit of
Malachy, he had been reconciled after a long estrangement (Agnew,
<i>Hereditary Sheriffs of Galloway</i>, 1893. vol. i. p. 58).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_573_573" id="Footnote_573_573"></a><a href="#FNanchor_573_573"><span class="label">[573]</span></a> <i>Lapasperi</i> is obviously the gen. of <i>Lapasper</i>, a
corruption of <i>Lapis asper</i> (rough stone). This seems to be a Latin
rendering of Cairngarroch (= <i>Carn garbh</i>), a name which occurs three
times on the shores of Wigtownshire. One of the places so called, on the
west coast of Luce Bay, may be set aside. The other two are seven or
eight miles apart, within sight of the Bangor coast, and nearly
equidistant from it; one in the parish of Stoneykirk, the other (now
known as Rough Cairn) in the parish of Geswalt. The late Sir Andrew
Agnew (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 59) regarded the latter as the place referred to in
the text on grounds which do not seem conclusive. Cairngarroch in
Stoneykirk is to be preferred for two reasons: it is more easily
approached from inland than its rival; and it has impressed its name on
the actual coast-line, which the other has not done; "Cairngarroch Bay"
is equivalent to <i>Port Cairn garbh</i>, and that to the <i>Portus Lapasperi</i>
of the text. This identification was first proposed by O'Hanlon (p. 81);
and its probability is increased now that the position of St. Michael's
Church has been fixed (see preceding note). But one of his arguments in
favour of it, based on the name of the parish, is fallacious; for
"Stoneykirk" has nothing to do with stones: it is a late corruption of
Steiniekirk = St. Stephen's Church.</p></div>

<p>42. (23). Malachy embarked in a ship, and after a prosperous voyage
landed at his monastery of Bangor,<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">576</a> so that his first sons might

they were when they received their father&mdash;and such a father&mdash;in good
health from so long a journey? No wonder if their whole heart gave
itself over to joy at his return, when swift rumour soon brought
incredible gladness even to the tribes<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> outside round about them. In
fine, from the cities and castles and hamlets they ran to meet him, and
wherever he turned he was received with <i>the joy of the whole
land</i>.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> But honour is not to his taste. He exercises his office as
legate; many assemblies are held in many places, so that no region, or

legation. He <i>sows beside all waters</i>;<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> there is not one who can

their necessities. In councils, which are everywhere held, the ancient
traditions are revived, which, though their excellence was undisputed,
had fallen into disuse by the negligence of the priests. And not only
are the old restored, new customs are also devised; and whatsoever
things he promulgated are accepted as though issued from heaven, are
held fast, are committed to writing for a memorial to posterity. Why
should we not believe those things were sent from heaven which so many
heavenly miracles confirm? And that I may make what has been said
credible, let me touch on some of these miracles in a few words. For who
can enumerate all? Though I confess I had rather dwell on those things
which can be imitated than on those which can only excite wonder.</p>

<p>43. (24). And in my judgement the first and greatest miracle that he
exhibited was himself.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> For to say nothing of his <i>inner man</i>,<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a>
the beauty and strength and purity of which his habits and life
sufficiently attested, he so bore himself even outwardly in a uniform
and consistent manner, and that the most modest and becoming, that
absolutely nothing appeared in him which could offend the beholders.
And, indeed, <i>he who offends not in word, the same is a perfect
man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">588</a> But yet in Malachy,

nod? Who ever knew his hand or his foot to move without purpose? Yea,
what was there that was not edifying in his gait, his mien, his bearing,
his countenance? In fine, neither did sadness darken nor laughter turn
to levity the joyousness of his countenance.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">590</a> Everything in him was

perfection. Always he was grave, but not austere. Relaxing at times, but
never careless; neglecting nothing, though for a time ignoring many
things. Quiet often, but by no means at any time idle.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">592</a> From the

ecclesiastical or secular, even when he was a bishop. There was nothing
whatever ordained or assigned for his episcopal mensa, by which the
bishop might live; for he had not even a house of his own. But he was
almost always going about all the parishes<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> serving the Gospel,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">596</a>
and <i>living of the Gospel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">597</a> as the Lord appointed for him when he

result of the labours of himself and his companions, he brought with
him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>that by which he might sustain himself and <i>those who laboured with
him in the work of the ministry</i>.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> Further, if at times he had to
rest he did so in the holy places which he himself had scattered through
the whole of Ireland; but he conformed to the customs and observances of
those with whom it pleased him to tarry, content with the common life
and the common table. There was nought in his food, nought in his
clothing, by which Malachy could be distinguished from the rest of the
brethren; to such a degree, though he was <i>greatest</i>, did he <i>humble
himself in all things</i>.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a></p>

<p>44. Then, when he went out to preach, he was accompanied by others
on foot, and on foot went he himself, the bishop and legate. That was
the apostolic rule; and it is the more to be admired in Malachy
because it is too rare in others. The true successor of the Apostles
assuredly is he who does such things. But it is to be observed how he
<i>divides the inheritance with his brothers</i>,<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> equally descendants

either do not preach the Gospel and yet eat, or preach the Gospel in

and oblations, besides customs and tributes by the gift of C&aelig;sar and
countless other revenues, nevertheless <i>take thought what they shall

<p>45. (25). There was a woman in the city of Coleraine<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">627</a> who had a
demon. Malachy was called; he prayed for the possessed; he commanded the
invader and he went out. But his iniquity was not yet fully satisfied,
and he entered into an unhappy woman who happened to be standing by. And
Malachy said, "I did not release that woman from your grasp in order
that you might enter this one; go out of her also." He obeyed, but went
back to the former woman; and driven forth from her once more, he again
went into the second. So for some time he vexed them alternately,
fleeing to and fro. Then the saint, indignant that he was mocked by a
demon, summoned up his spirit, and shouted; and when he had made an
attack on the adversary with all the forces of faith, he drove the demon
away from both, no less vexed than those whom he had vexed. But do not
suppose, reader, that the delay which he caused the saint was due to his
own strength: it was permitted by the divine dispensation, evidently in
order that by this as well the power of the evil one as the victory of
Malachy might be made more manifest.</p>

<p>Hear now what he did elsewhere, but not by reason of his presence.
Assuredly what he had power to accomplish when absent, he could do also
when present.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>46. In a district of the northern part of Ireland a sick man lay in his
house. His sickness was beyond doubt due to the evil influence of
demons. For one night he heard them talking; and one said to another,
"See that this wretched man does not touch the bed or bedding of that
hypocrite, and so escape from our hands." The man perceived that they
were speaking of Malachy, who, as he remembered, had not long before
passed a night in that house. And the bedding was still in its place;
and taking courage, with his utmost effort he began to crawl, weak in
body but strong in faith. And lo, in the air there was clamour and
shouting: "Stop him, stop him, hold him, hold him; we are losing our
prey." But, carried on by faith and the desire to escape, the more they
shouted the more he hastened to the remedy, straining with knees and
hands. And when he reached the couch, and went up on it, he rolled
himself in the bed-clothes, and heard the wailing of them that lamented,
"Alas, alas, we have betrayed ourselves, we have been deceived, he has
escaped."<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a> And quicker than a word, there left him the terror of the
demons and the horror which he suffered, and with them all his sickness.</p>

<p>In the city of Lismore a man vexed by a demon was delivered by Malachy.</p>

<p>Also once, when he was passing through Leinster, an infant was brought
to him who had a demon, and he was brought back whole.</p>

<p>In the same region he ordered a mad woman,<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> bound with cords, to be
loosed and to be bathed in water which he blessed. She washed and was
healed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Another woman also in Saul,<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> a region of Ulaid,<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> who was tearing
her own limbs with her teeth, he cured by praying and touching her.</p>

<p>There was a madman, who predicted many things to come. His friends and
neighbours brought him to the man of God, bound strongly with cords,
because his very madness had made him strong to do hurt and exceeding
terrible. Malachy prayed, and immediately the sick man was healed and
released. This was done in a certain place, the name of which we omit
because it has a very barbarous sound, as also have many others.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></p>

<p>At another time in the above-mentioned city of Lismore,<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> the parents
of a dumb girl<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> brought her to him in the midst of the street as he
passed, asking him with much entreaty that he would deign to help her.
Malachy stood and prayed; and he <i>touched her tongue</i> with his finger
and <i>spat</i><a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> upon her mouth, and sent her away speaking.</p>

<p>47. (26). Going out of a certain church he met a man with his wife, and
she could not speak. And when he was asked to have mercy on her, he
stood in the gate, the people surrounding him; and he gave a blessing
upon her, and bade her say the Lord's Prayer. She said it, and the
people blessed the Lord.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>In a city called Antrim<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">636</a> a certain man lying on a bed, now deprived
for twelve days of the use of his tongue, at the bidding of the saint,
who visited him, recovered his speech and received the Eucharist; and so
fortified he breathed his last breath in <i>a good confession</i>.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> O,
<i>fruitful olive tree in the house of God</i>!<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> O, <i>oil</i> of
gladness,<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> giving both anointing and light! By the splendour of the
miracle he gave light to those who were whole, by the graciousness of
the favour he anointed the sick man, and obtained for him, soon about to
die, the saving power of confession and communion.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">640</a></p>

<p>One of the nobles came in to him, <i>having somewhat to say to him</i>;<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">641</a>
and while they were speaking, <i>full of faith</i><a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> piously stole three
rushes from the couch on which Malachy sat, and took them with him: and
God wrought many things as a result of the pious theft, by that man's
faith and the sanctity of the prelate.</p>

<p>By chance he had come to a city called Cloyne.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> And when he was
sitting at table a nobleman of that city came in and humbly prayed him
for his wife, who was pregnant, and had passed the appointed time of
parturition, so that all wondered, and there was none <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>who did not
believe that her life was in danger. With him also Nehemiah,<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> the
bishop of that city, who was sitting next to him, made request to
Malachy, and others also as many as were present reclining together.
Then he said, "I pity her, for she is a good and modest woman." And
offering the man a cup which he had blessed, he said, "Go, give her to
drink, and know that when she has taken the draught of blessing<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">645</a> she
will bring forth without delay, and without danger." It was done as he
commanded, and that very night there followed that which he promised.</p>

<p>He was sitting in a plain with the count of Ulaid, dealing with certain
matters, <i>and a great multitude</i><a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> was about them. There came a woman
who had long been with child. She declared that contrary to all the laws
of nature she had already been pregnant for fifteen months and twenty
days. Malachy having pity for this new and unheard-of trouble, prayed,
and the woman was delivered. Those who were present rejoiced and
wondered. For all saw with what ease and rapidity she brought forth in
the same place, and the sad portent of birth denied was changed to a
happier marvel.</p>

<p>48. (27). There happened in the same place an event with a similar
miracle but a different issue. He saw a man who was reported to be
consorting publicly with his brother's concubine; and he was a knight, a
servant of the count. And publicly accosting the incestuous man he
displayed himself to him as another John, saying, <i>It is not lawful for
thee to have thy brother's</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>concubine.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> But he, nevertheless, in
his turn displaying himself to Malachy as another Herod, not only did
not hearken to him, but even answered him haughtily, and before them all
swore that he would never put her away. Then Malachy, much agitated, for
he was vehemently zealous for righteousness, said, "Then God shall
separate you from her against your will." Paying little heed the man
went away at once in a rage. And meeting the woman not far from the
crowd which was in the place, he treated her evilly and with violence,
as though he wholly belonged to <i>Satan</i> to whom he had a little before
been <i>delivered</i>.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> Nor was the crime hidden. The damsel who
accompanied the lady ran back to the house (for it was not far from the
place), and, breathless, announced the wickedness that had taken place.
At the word her brothers, who were at home, enraged at the dishonour
done to their sister, rushed thither with all haste and slew the enemy
of virtue, <i>taken in the very</i> place and <i>act</i><a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">649</a> of crime, piercing
him with many wounds. The assembly was not yet dismissed when, lo! his
armour-bearer proclaimed what had happened. And all wondered that the
sentence of Malachy had taken such speedy effect. When this word was
heard all evil-doers (for there were many in the land) feared and, being
terrified, purified themselves, <i>washing their hands in the blood of the
ungodly</i>.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">650</a></p>

<p>49. (28). Dermot the count,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> who had now for a long time lain on his
bed, he sprinkled with blessed water, and caused him to rise up without
delay, and so strong <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>that he mounted his horse on the spot, surpassing
assuredly the hope of himself and of his friends&mdash;rebuking him severely
at the same time because he was a bad man <i>serving his belly</i><a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> and
his appetite immoderately.</p>

<p>In the town of Cashel a man came before him with his paralysed son,
asking that he should be healed.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> And Malachy, praying briefly,
said, "<i>Go thy way; thy son</i> shall be made whole."<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> He went, and on
the morrow he returned with his son, who was nevertheless by no means
whole. Then Malachy rose and standing over him prayed at greater length,
and he was made whole. And turning to the father he said, "Offer him to
God." The man assented, but did not keep his promise; and after some
years his son, now a young man, relapsed into the same state, no doubt
because of his father's disobedience and his violation of the pledge.</p>

<p>Another man came from a long distance, when Malachy was in the borders
of Munster, bringing to him his son, who was entirely deprived of the
use of his feet. When he inquired how this had happened to him, he said,
"As I suspect, by the malignity of demons"; adding, "It was they, if I
mistake not, who, when he was playing in a field, <i>caused a sleep to
fall</i> upon him,<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> and when the child awoke he found himself so."
Saying this, he poured forth his petition with tears, and earnestly
sought help. Malachy pitying him prayed, bidding the sick boy in the
meantime to sleep there upon the ground. He slept, and he arose whole.
Because he had <i>come from far</i><a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> he kept him some time in his
company, and he used to walk with him.</p>

<p>50. In the monastery of Bangor a certain poor man was maintained by the
alms of the brothers; and he received a small sum every day, for
performing some <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>office in the mill. He had been lame for twelve years,
creeping on the ground with his hands, and dragging his dead feet after
him. Him Malachy found one day before his cell, sad and sorrowful, and
asked him the cause. And he said, "You see how for a long time I am
miserably troubled and <i>the hand of the Lord is upon me</i>;<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> and lo,
to increase my distress, men who ought to have had pity, rather laugh at
me and cast my wretchedness in my teeth." And when he heard him, moved
with compassion, he <i>looked up to heaven</i>,<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> at the same time raising
his hands. Having said a short prayer he entered his cell, and the other
rose up. And standing upon his feet he wondered if it was true,
suspecting that he was in a dream.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> But he began to move with slow
steps, for he did not altogether believe that he could walk. At length,
<i>as it were waking out of a deep sleep</i>,<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">660</a> he recognized the mercy of
the Lord upon him; he walked firmly, and returned to the mill <i>leaping</i>
and exulting <i>and praising God</i>. When those saw him who had before seen
and <i>known him</i> they <i>were filled with wonder and amazement,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">661</a>
supposing it to be a spirit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">662</a></p>

<p>Malachy likewise healed a dropsical man by praying, who remained there
in the monastery and was appointed shepherd.</p>

<p>51. A city of Ireland called Cork was without a bishop. They proceeded
to an election; but the various parties did not agree, each, as is
usual, wishing to appoint their own bishop, not God's.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> Malachy
came <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>to the place when he heard of the disagreement. Calling together
the clergy and people he took pains to unite the hearts and desires of
the opposing parties. And when they had been persuaded that the whole
business ought to be entrusted to him, on whom in a very special manner
lay <i>the care of</i> that as also of the other <i>churches</i><a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> throughout
Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">665</a> immediately he named to them, not any of the nobles of the
land,<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> but rather a certain poor man whom he knew to be holy and
learned; <i>and he was a stranger</i>.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> He was sought; and it was
announced <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>that he was lying in bed, and so weak that he could in no
wise go out unless carried in the hands of those who ministered to him.
"Let him rise," said Malachy; "in the name of the Lord I command it;
obedience will save him." What was he to do? He wished to obey, but he
thought himself unfitted; for though it should be possible for him to
go, he dreaded to be a bishop. So with the will to be obedient twin
enemies were contending, the load of weakness and the fear of the
burden. But the first conquered, the hope of salvation being given him
as an aid. Therefore he made the attempt, he moved, tested his power,
discovered that he was stronger than usual. Faith increased along with
power, and again faith made stronger gave in its turn increase of power.
Now he was able to rise unassisted, now to walk somewhat better, now not
even to perceive weariness in walking; at length, to come to Malachy
without difficulty and quickly, unaided by man. He promoted him, and put
him into the chair, with the applause of clergy and people. This was
done without question, because neither did they dare to oppose the will
of Malachy in any way, seeing the sign which he had wrought; nor did he
hesitate to obey, being made surer, by so evident a proof, of the will
of God.</p>

<p>52. (29). A certain <i>woman was diseased with an issue of blood</i>;<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">668</a>
and she was of noble birth and very dear to Malachy, though by reason of
the nobility rather of her character than of her descent. When she was
entirely failing, her strength no doubt being exhausted with her blood,
and was now near the end, she sent to the man of God, in order that&mdash;the
only thing that remained to be done&mdash;he might help her soul who should
see her no <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>more in the body. When Malachy heard it he was troubled,
because she was a woman of virtue, and her life fruitful in work and
example. And perceiving that he could not reach her in time he called
Malchus, for he was young and active (he is that brother of Abbot
Christian whom we mentioned above),<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">669</a> and said, "Haste, take her
these three apples on which I have invoked the name of the Lord; I am
assured of this, that when she tastes these she <i>shall not taste of
death</i> before <i>she sees</i> us,<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> though we shall follow somewhat more
slowly." Malchus hastened as he was commanded, and when he came he went
in to the dying woman, showing himself another servant of Elisha, except
that his work was more efficacious.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">671</a> He bade her take that which
Malachy had blessed and sent to her, and to taste it if by any means she
could. But she was so refreshed when she heard Malachy's name, that she
was able to obey, and indicated by a nod (for she could not speak) that
she wished to be raised up for a little while. She was raised up, she
tasted; she was strengthened by what she tasted, she spoke, and gave
thanks. <i>And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon</i> her,<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> and
she rested most sweetly in it, having long ceased to enjoy the benefit
of sleep, or to partake of food. Meanwhile <i>her blood was
staunched</i><a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> and awaking after a while she found herself whole,<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">674</a>
but she was still weak from long fasting and loss of blood. If in any
degree the cure was not complete,<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> on the following day the
wished-for presence and appearance of Malachy made it perfect.</p>

<p>53. (30). A nobleman lived in the neighbourhood of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>the monastery of
Bangor, whose wife was <i>sick nigh unto death</i>.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">676</a> Malachy, being asked
to <i>come down ere she died</i>,<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">677</a> to <i>anoint the sick</i> woman <i>with
oil</i>,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> came down and went in to her; and when she saw him she
rejoiced greatly, animated by the hope of salvation. And when he was
preparing to anoint her, it seemed to all that it ought rather to be
postponed to the morning; for it was evening. Malachy assented, and when
he had given a blessing over the sick woman, he went out with those who
were with him. But shortly afterwards, suddenly <i>there was a cry
made</i>,<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">679</a> lamentation and great wailing through the whole house, for
it was reported that she had died. Malachy ran up when he heard the
tumult, and his disciples followed him. And coming to the bed, when he
had assured himself that she had breathed her last, he was greatly
troubled in mind, blaming himself that she had died without the grace of
the sacrament. And lifting up his hands to heaven he said, "<i>I beseech
thee</i>, Lord, <i>I have done very foolishly</i>. I, even <i>I, have
sinned</i>,<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">680</a> who postponed, not she who desired it." Saying this he
protested in the hearing of all that <i>he</i> would not <i>be comforted</i>,<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">681</a>
that he would give <i>no rest to his spirit</i>,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> unless he should be
allowed to restore the grace which he had taken away. And standing over
her, all night <i>he laboured in his groaning</i>; and, instead of the holy
oil, flooding the dead woman with a great rain of <i>tears</i>,<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">683</a> he
bestowed on her such a substitute for the unction as he could. Thus did
he; but to his companions he said, "<i>Watch and pray.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> So they in
psalms, he in tears, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>passed a night of vigil. And when the morning came
the Lord heard His saint, for the <i>Spirit</i> of the Lord was <i>making
intercession for him</i>, who <i>maketh intercession for</i> the saints <i>with
groanings that cannot be uttered</i>.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">685</a> Why more? She who had been dead
<i>opened her eyes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">686</a> and, as those do who wake from a deep sleep,
rubbing her forehead and temples with her hands, she rose upon the bed,
and recognizing Malachy, devoutly saluted him with bowed head. And
mourning being <i>turned into joy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">687</a> amazement took hold of all, both
those who saw and those who heard. And Malachy also gave thanks and
blessed the Lord. And he anointed her, nevertheless, knowing that in
that sacrament <i>sins are forgiven</i>, and that <i>the prayer of faith saves

had enjoined upon her, and again <i>fell asleep</i><a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">690</a> in a <i>good
confession</i>,<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> and passed to the Lord.</p>

<p>54. (3). There was also a woman whom <i>a spirit of</i> anger and <i>fury</i><a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">692</a>
dominated to such an extent that not only her neighbours and relatives
fled from her society, but even her own sons could scarcely endure to
live with her. Shouting, rancour and <i>a mighty tempest</i><a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> wherever
she was. Violent, fiery, hasty, terrible with tongue and hand,
intolerable to all, and hated. Her sons, grieving both for her and for
themselves, dragged her into the presence of Malachy, setting forth
their lamentable complaint with tears. But the holy man, pitying both
the sickness of the mother and the trouble of her sons, called her
aside, and made urgent inquiry <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>whether she had ever confessed her sins.
She replied, "Never." "Confess," said he. She obeyed; and he enjoined
penance on her when she made confession, and prayed over her that
Almighty God might give her <i>the spirit of meekness</i>,<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> and in the
name of the Lord Jesus bade her to be angry no more. Such meekness
followed that it was plain to all that it was nothing else than a
marvellous <i>change effected by the right hand of the Most High</i>.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">695</a> It
is said that she is still living to-day, and is so patient and gentle
that, though she used to exasperate all, now she cannot be exasperated
by any injuries or insults or afflictions. If it be allowed me, as the
Apostle says, <i>to be fully persuaded in my own mind</i>,<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> let each
accept it as he will; for me, I give it as my opinion that this miracle
should be regarded as superior to that of raising the dead woman,
mentioned above, inasmuch as there the outward, but here the <i>inner
man</i><a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> was restored to life. And now let us hasten to what remains.</p>

<p>55. A man who as regards the world was honourable, as regards God
devout, came to Malachy and complained to him concerning <i>the barrenness
of his soul</i>,<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">698</a> praying that he would obtain for him from Almighty
God the grace of tears. And Malachy, smiling because he was pleased that
there should be spiritual desire from a man of the world, laid his cheek
on the cheek of the other as though caressing him, and said, "<i>Be it
done unto you as you have asked</i>."<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> From that time <i>rivers of waters
ran down his eyes</i><a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">700</a> so great and so nearly incessant that the phrase
of Scripture might seem applicable to him: "<i>A fountain of gardens, a
well of living waters</i>."<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">701</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>There is an island of the sea in Ireland, from of old fruitful of
fishes;<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> and the sea there abounds in fish. By the sins of the
inhabitants, as it is believed, the wonted supply was taken away, and
<i>she that had many children was waxed feeble</i>,<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> and her own great
usefulness utterly dwindled away. While the natives were grieving, and
the peoples taking ill the great loss, it was revealed to a certain
woman that a remedy might be effected by the prayers of Malachy; and
that became known to all, for she herself proclaimed it. By the will of
God it happened that Malachy arrived. For while he was going round and
filling the region with the Gospel, he turned aside thither that to them
also he might impart the same grace.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> But <i>the barbarous
people</i>,<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> who cared more for the fishes,<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">706</a> demanded with all
vehemence that he would deign to regard rather the sterility of their
island. And when he answered that it was not for that he had come, but
that he desired to catch men rather than fish,<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">707</a> yet seeing their
faith<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> he <i>kneeled down on the shore and prayed</i><a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">709</a> to the Lord
that, though they were unworthy of it, he would not deny them the
benefit granted long before, since they sought it again with so great
faith. <i>The prayer went up</i>,<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">710</a> there came up also <i>a multitude of
fishes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> and perhaps more fruitful than in ancient days; and the
people of the land continue to enjoy that abundance to this day. What
wonder if <i>the prayer of a righteous man</i> which <i>penetrates the
heavens</i>,<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> penetrated <i>the abysses</i>,<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> and called forth from the
depth of the sea so great supplies of fish?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>56. There came, on one occasion, three bishops into the village of
Faughart,<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">714</a> which they say was the birthplace of Brigit the
virgin;<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> and Malachy was a fourth. And the presbyter who had
received them with hospitality, said to him, "What shall I do, for I
have no fish?" And when he answered that he should seek them from the
fishermen, he said, "For the last two years no fish have been found in
the river;<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> and for that reason the fishermen also are all scattered
and have even abandoned their art." And Malachy replied "Command them to
<i>let down the nets</i><a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> in the name of the Lord." It was done, and
twelve salmon were caught. They lowered them a second time, and catching
as many more they brought to the tables both an unlooked-for dish and an
unlooked-for miracle. And that it might be clear that this was granted
to the merits of Malachy, the same sterility nevertheless continued also
for the following two years.</p>

founded. But we cannot be sure that St. Bernard is correct when he says
that the clergy and people met to elect a bishop, in view of his
inability elsewhere (&sect; 19) to distinguish bishops from abbots. It is at
least possible that there was strife between different septs concerning
the appointment of a coarb of Barre, founder of the church of Cork.
Malachy may have taken advantage of the strife to nominate a ruler who
belonged to no sept in the district and who would allow himself to be
consecrated bishop. The vacancy may have been made by the death of
Donnell Shalvey, erenach of Cork, in 1140 (<i>A.F.M.</i>). The word <i>erenach</i>
is sometimes used at this period where we might have expected to find
<i>abbot</i> (cp. <i>A.F.M.</i> 1137, quoted in Additional Note C, p. 167).</p></div>

the leading men of a sept would be appointed, according to prevalent

selection of a "poor man," who was not a local magnate, as diocesan

Muidhin, who attended the Synod of Kells in 1152 as bishop of Cork
(Keating, iii. 317), and died in 1172 (<i>A.U.</i>). Since he attained "a
good old age" there is no reason why he should not have been consecrated
as early as 1140 or 1141. He had been a monk of Errew in Lough Con, co.
Mayo (<i>A.T.</i> 1172), and was therefore "a stranger," <i>i.e.</i> not a native
of Munster. He is called a "poor man," no doubt, for the same reason as
Malachy himself (&sect; 24), because he had embraced the life of voluntary
poverty. He had a reputation for piety and learning, for the Annals
describe him as "full of the grace of God" (<i>A.U.</i>), and "the tower of
devotion and wisdom and virginity of Ireland" (<i>A.T.</i>). And if the
tradition is trustworthy that he was abbot of St. John the Evangelist at
Cork, founded by Cormac Mac Carthy "for pilgrims from Connaught" (see
the charter of Dermot Mac Carthy printed in Gibson's <i>History of Cork</i>,
ii. 348), and that it received its later name of Gill Abbey from him, we
can explain how he came to be near at hand when the election was taking
place.</p></div>

<p class="subhead2a"><i>He does battle for the faith; he restores peace among those who were at
variance; he takes in hand to build a stone church.</i></p>


<p>57. (32). There was a certain clerk in Lismore whose life, as it is
said, was good, but his faith not so. He was a man of some knowledge in
his own eyes, and dared to say that in the Eucharist there is only a
sacrament and not the fact<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">718</a> of the sacrament, that is, mere
sanctification and not the truth of the Body. On this subject he was
often addressed by Malachy in secret, but in vain; and finally he was
called before a public assembly, the laity however being excluded, in
order that if it were possible, he should be healed and not put to
confusion.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> So in a gathering of clerics the man was given
opportunity to answer for his opinion. And when with all his powers of
ingenuity, in which he had no slight skill, he attempted to assert and
defend his error, Malachy disputing against him and convicting him, in
the judgement of all, he was worsted; and he retired, put to confusion
by the unanimity though not sentenced to punishment.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">720</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>But he said
that he was not overcome by reason, but crushed by the authority of the
bishop. "And you, Malachy," said he, "have put me to confusion this day
without good reason, speaking assuredly against the truth and contrary
to your own conscience." Malachy, sad for a man so hardened, but
grieving more for the injury that was done to the faith, and fearing
dangerous developments, called the church together,<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> publicly
censured the erring one, publicly admonished him to repent, the bishops
and the whole clergy urging him to the same effect. When he did not
submit, they pronounced an anathema upon him as contumacious and
proclaimed him a heretic. But not aroused from sleep by this he said,
"You all favour the man, not the truth; I do not accept persons so that
I should <i>forsake the truth</i>."<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">722</a> To this word the saint made answer
with some heat, "The Lord make you confess the truth even of necessity;"
and when he replied "Amen" the assembly was dissolved. Burnt with such a
branding-iron he meditated flight, for he could not bear to be of ill
repute and dishonoured. And forthwith he departed, carrying his
belongings; when lo, seized with sudden weakness, he stood still, and
his strength failing he threw himself on the ground in the same spot,
panting and weary. A vagabond madman, arriving by chance at that place,
came upon the man and asked him what he did there. He replied that he
was suffering from great weakness and unable either to advance or to go
back. And the other said, "This weakness is nothing else than death
itself." <i>But this he spake not of himself, but</i><a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> God fitly rebuked
by means of a madman him who would not submit to the sane counsels of
men of understanding. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>And he said, "Return home, I will help you."
Finally with his guidance he went back into the city: he returned to his
right mind and to the mercy of the Lord. In the same hour the bishop was
summoned, the truth was acknowledged, error was renounced. He confessed
his guilt and was absolved. He asked for the viaticum, and
reconciliation was granted; and almost in the same moment his perfidy
was renounced by his mouth and dissolved by his death. So, to the wonder
of all, with all speed was fulfilled the word of Malachy, and with it
that of the Scripture which says, "<i>Trouble gives understanding to the
hearing.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">724</a></p>

<p>58. (33). Between the peoples of certain regions there once arose
grievous discord.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> Malachy was importuned to make peace between
them, and because he was hindered by other business he committed this
matter to one of the bishops. He made excuse and refused, saying that
Malachy, not he, had been sought for, that he would be despised, that he
was unwilling to take trouble to no purpose. "<i>Go</i>," said Malachy, "<i>and
the Lord be with you</i>."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> He replied, "I assent, but if they will not
hear me, know that I will appeal to your Fatherhood." Smiling, Malachy
said, "Be it so." Then the bishop, having called the parties together,
dictated terms of peace; they assented and were reconciled to one
another, security was given on both sides, and peace was established;
and so he dismissed them. But one party, seeing that their enemies had
become careless and were unprepared, because peace having been made they
suspected no harm, <i>said</i> among themselves, each man <i>to his
neighbour</i>,<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> "What are we minded to do? Victory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>and vengeance on
our foes is in our grasp"; and they began to attack them. What was
happening became known to the bishop, and hastening up he charged their
chief with wickedness and guile, but he treated him with contempt. He
invoked the name of Malachy against him, and he paid no attention to it.
Laughing at the bishop he said, "Do you suppose that for you we ought to
let those go who did evil to us, whom <i>God hath delivered into our
hands</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> And the bishop, remembering the conversation which he had
had with Malachy, <i>weeping and wailing</i>,<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">729</a> turned his face towards
Malachy's monastery<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> and said, "Where art thou, man of God, where
art thou? Is not this, my father, what I told thee of? Alas, alas, I
came here that I might do good and not evil; and behold, through me all
are perishing, these in the body, those in the soul." Many things in
this manner said he as he <i>mourned</i> and <i>lamented</i>,<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> and he urged
and addressed Malachy, as though he were present, against the wicked.
But meanwhile the impious men did not cease to attack those with whom
they had made peace, so as to destroy them; and behold there was <i>a
lying spirit in the mouth of</i> certain men to <i>deceive</i> them.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">732</a> And
these men met them in the way announcing that a raid had been made into
their lands by their adversaries, that all things were being consumed
<i>with the edge of the sword</i>,<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> and that their goods were being laid
waste, and their wives and children taken and led away. When they heard
this they returned in haste. The hindmost followed the first, <i>not
knowing whither they went</i><a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> or what had happened; for they had not
all heard <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>the men who spoke. And when they came and found none of those
things which had been told them they were confounded, taken in their own
wickedness;<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">735</a> and they <i>knew</i> that they had been given up to <i>the
spirit of error</i>,<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> on account of the messenger of Malachy whom they
deceived and his <i>name</i> which <i>they despised</i>.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">737</a> Further, the bishop,
when he heard that the traitors were foiled in the iniquity which they
had devised, returned with joy to Malachy and told him all things in
order which had happened to him.</p>

<p>59. Malachy, knowing that by such an event the peace was disturbed,
taking suitable opportunity was at pains in his own person to restore
peace once more between them, and to confirm it when restored by the
giving and receiving of security and an oath on both sides. But those
who before had suffered from the violation of peace, mindful of the
injury, and ignoring the agreement and the command of Malachy, took in
hand to make reprisals. And all coming together, they set out to take
their enemies unprepared and to return upon their own head the evil
which they had thought to do to them.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> And when they had very easily
forded a great river which lay between them, they were stopped by a
rivulet to which they came, not far from it. For indeed now it was not a
rivulet, but appeared clearly to be a huge river, denying passage in
every part of it to those who desired to cross it. All wondered that it
was now so great, knowing how small it had been before, and they said
among themselves, "What has caused this inundation? The air is clear,
there are no rains, and we do not remember that there have been any
lately; and even if there had been much rain, which of us remembers
that, to however great a flood it swelled, it ever before <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>covered the
land, spreading over sown ground and meadow? <i>This is the finger of
God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">739</a> and the Lord <i>is hedging up our ways</i>,<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">740</a> on account of
Malachy, His saint, whose <i>covenant we have transgressed</i><a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> and
disobeyed his commandment."<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> So these also, without accomplishing
their purpose, returned to their own territory, likewise confounded. The
report was spread <i>throughout all the region</i>;<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> and they blessed
God, who <i>took the wise in their own craftiness</i>,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">744</a> <i>and cutting off
the horns of the wicked</i>,<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> <i>exalted the horn of His anointed</i>.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">746</a></p>

<p>60. One of the nobles hostile to the king<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> was reconciled by means
of Malachy. For he did not trust the king sufficiently to make peace
with him except by the mediation of Malachy, or of one for whom the king
had equal reverence. His distrust was not unfounded, as afterwards
appeared. For when he had become careless, and was no longer taking
precautions, the king captured him and put him in bonds, more truly
himself captured by ancient hate. His own friends demanded him by <i>the
hand of the mediator</i>;<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">748</a> for neither did they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>expect anything but
his death. What should Malachy do? There was nothing to be done except
to recur to that one accustomed refuge of his. Gathering an exceeding
mighty army, a great crowd of his own disciples, he went to the king,
and demanded him who was bound; he was refused. But Malachy said, "You
act unrighteously against the Lord, and against me, and against
yourself, <i>transgressing the covenant</i>;<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">749</a> if you disregard it, yet
shall not I. A man has entrusted himself to my guarantee; if he should
die, I have betrayed him. I am guilty of his blood. Why has it seemed
good to you to make me a traitor, yourself a transgressor? Know that <i>I
will eat nothing until</i><a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> he is liberated; no, nor these
either."<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> Having said this he entered the church. He called upon
Almighty God with anxious groanings, his own and those of his disciples,
that He would deign to <i>deliver out of the hand of the transgressor and
cruel man</i><a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> him who was unjustly sentenced. And that day and the
following night they persisted in fasting and prayer. Word was brought
to the king of that which was being done; and his <i>heart was</i> the more
<i>hardened</i><a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> by that by which it ought to have been softened. The
carnal man took to flight, fearing lest if he remained near at hand he
might not be able to withstand the power of prayer; as though, forsooth,
if he was hidden it could not find him, nor would penetrate to a remote
place. Do you put bounds, wretched man, to <i>the prayers of saints</i>?<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">754</a>
Is prayer an arrow that has been shot, that you may <i>flee from the face
of the bow</i>?<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">755</a> <i>Whither wilt thou go from the Spirit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>of God</i>, who
carries it, <i>or whither wilt thou flee from His presence</i>?<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">756</a> At last
Malachy pursues the fugitive, he finds him who lies hidden. "<i>You shall
be blind and not seeing</i>,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">757</a> that you may see better, and may
understand that <i>it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.</i><a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">758</a>
Nay, perceive even now that <i>sharp arrows of the mighty</i><a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> have come
to you, which, although they have rebounded from your heart, because it
is of stone, have not rebounded from your eyes. Would that even through
the windows of the eyes they might reach to the heart, and <i>trouble give
understanding</i><a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> to blindness." It could be seen that <i>Saul</i> again
was <i>led by the hand</i><a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> and brought to Ananias, a wolf to a sheep,
that he might disgorge his prey. He disgorged it and <i>received
sight</i>,<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> for to such a degree was Malachy like a sheep, if, for
example, it were to take pity even on the wolf. Note carefully from
this, reader, with whom Malachy had his dwelling, what sort of princes
they were, what sort of peoples. How is it that he also was not <i>a
brother to dragons, and a companion to owls</i>?<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> And therefore the
Lord <i>gave him power to tread upon serpents and scorpions</i>,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> <i>to
bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of
iron</i>.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> Hear now what follows.</p>

<p>61. (34). He to whom Malachy had yielded the possessions of the
monastery of Bangor,<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> ungrateful for the benefit, from that time
forward behaved himself always most arrogantly against him and his
followers, hostile to them in all things, plotting everywhere, and
disparaging his deeds. But not without punishment. He had an only son,
who, imitating his father and daring himself to act in opposition to
Malachy, died the same year. And <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>thus he died. It seemed good to
Malachy that a stone oratory should be erected at Bangor like those
which he had seen constructed in other regions.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> And when he began
to lay the foundations the natives wondered, because in that land no
such buildings were yet to be found.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">768</a> But that worthless fellow,
presumptuous and arrogant as he was, not only wondered but was
indignant. And from that indignation <i>he conceived grief and brought
forth iniquity</i>.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> And he became a <i>talebearer among the
peoples</i>,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> now <i>disparaging secretly</i>,<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> now speaking evil
openly; drawing attention to Malachy's frivolity, shuddering at the
novelty, exaggerating the expense. With such poisonous words as these he
was urging and inducing many to put a stop to it: "Follow me, and what
ought not to be done by any but ourselves let us not permit to be done
against our will." Then with many whom he was able to persuade&mdash;<i>himself
the</i> first <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><i>leader in speech</i><a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> as well as the origin of the
evil&mdash;he went down to the place, and finding the man of God accosted
him: "Good sir, why have you thought good to introduce this novelty into
our regions? We are Scots, not Gauls. What is this frivolity? What need
was there for a work so superfluous, so proud? Where will you, <i>a poor
and needy man</i>,<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> find <i>the means to finish it</i>?<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">774</a> Who will see it
finished? What sort of presumption is this, to begin, I say not what you
cannot finish, but what you cannot even see finished? Though indeed it
is the act of a maniac rather than of a presumptuous man to attempt what
is beyond his measure, what exceeds his strength, what baffles his
abilities. Cease, cease, desist from this madness. If not, we shall not
permit it, we shall not tolerate it." This he said, proclaiming what he
would do, but not considering what it was within his power to do. For
some of those on whom he counted and whom he had brought with him, when
they saw the man<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">775</a> changed their minds and went no more with
him.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">776</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p><p>62. And to him the holy man spoke quite freely: "Wretched man, the work
which you see begun, and on which you look askance, shall undoubtedly be
finished: many shall see it finished. But you, because you do not wish
it, will not see it;<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">777</a> and that which you wish not shall be yours&mdash;to
die: take heed that you do not <i>die in your sins</i>."<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">778</a> So it happened:
he died, and the work was finished; but he saw it not, for, as we have
said already, he died the same year. Meanwhile the father, who soon
heard what the holy man had foretold concerning his son, and knew that
his word was <i>quick and powerful</i>,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">779</a> said, "He <i>has slain my
son</i>."<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> And by the instigation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>of the devil he burned with such
rage against him that he was not afraid, before the duke and magnates of
Ulaid, to accuse of falsehood and lying him who was most truthful and a
disciple and lover of the Truth; and he used violent language against
him, calling him an ape.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">781</a> And Malachy, who had been taught not to
<i>render railing for railing,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> was dumb, and opened not his
mouth<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> while the wicked was before him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">784</a> But the Lord was not
forgetful of His word which He had spoken, <i>Vengeance is mine, I will
repay</i>.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">785</a> The same day when the man returned home he expiated the
rashness of his unbridled tongue, the avenger being the very one at
whose instigation he had let it loose. The demon seized him and cast him
into the fire, but he was soon pulled out by those that stood by; yet
with his body partly burnt, and deprived of reason. And while he was
raving Malachy was called, and when he came he found the accursed man,
his foaming mouth contorted, terrifying all things with horrible sounds
and movements, his whole body writhing, and scarcely to be kept in
restraint by many men. And when he prayed for his enemy the man of all
perfection was heard, but only in part. For in a moment, while the saint
was praying, he opened his eyes, and recovered his understanding. But
<i>an evil spirit of the Lord</i><a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">786</a> was left to him <i>to buffet him,<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">787</a>
that he might learn not to blaspheme</i>.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> We believe that he still
lives, and up to this time is expiating the great sin which he sinned
against the saint; but they say that at certain times he is a lunatic.
Further, the aforesaid possessions, since he could no longer hold them
by reason of his helplessness and uselessness, returned in peace to the
place to which they had belonged. Nor did Malachy refuse them, when the
prospect of peace was held out at length after so much trouble.</p>

<p>63. But now our narrative must return to the work of the building which
Malachy had undertaken. And though Malachy had not the means, I do not
say to finish it, but to do any part of it, yet <i>his heart trusted in
the Lord</i>.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">789</a> The Lord, in fact, provided that, though he <i>set not his
hope on treasures of money</i>,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> money should not be lacking. For who
else caused a treasure to be stored in that place, and being stored, not
to be found till the time and work of Malachy? The servant of God found
in God's purse what was not in his own. Deservedly, indeed. For what
more just than that he who for God's sake possessed nothing should enter
into partnership with God, and that they should both <i>have one
purse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">791</a> For the man who believes, the whole world is a treasury of
riches; and what is it but a kind of purse of God? Indeed He says, <i>The
world is mine, and the fulness thereof</i>.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> Hence it was that when
many pieces of silver were found Malachy did not put them back in their
place, but took them out of their place; for he bade the whole gift of
God to be spent on the work of God.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">793</a> He considered not his own
necessities nor those of his companions, but <i>cast his</i> thought upon
<i>the Lord</i>,<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">794</a> to whom he did not doubt that he ought to resort as
often as need required. And there is no doubt that that was the work of
God, because Malachy had foreseen it by God's revelation. He had first
consulted with the brothers concerning that work; and many on account
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>of their lack of means were unwilling to assent to it. Anxious therefore
and doubtful what he should do, he began to inquire earnestly in prayer
what was the will of God. And one day coming back from a journey,<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">795</a>
when he drew near to the place he viewed it some way off; and lo, there
appeared a great oratory, of stone and very beautiful. And paying
careful attention to its position, form and construction, he took up the
work with confidence, having first however related the vision to a few
of the elder brothers. Indeed so carefully did he adhere to all his
attentive observations regarding place and manner and quality that when
the work was finished that which was made appeared closely similar to
that which he had seen, as if he also as well as Moses had heard the
saying, <i>Look</i> that <i>thou make all things according to the pattern
shewed to thee in the mount</i>.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">796</a> By the same kind of vision there was
shown to him before it was built, not only the oratory, but also the
whole monastery, which is situated at Saul.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">797</a></p>

<p>64. (35). As he was passing through a certain city and a great multitude
was running together to him, by chance he saw a young man among the rest
eager <i>to see</i> him.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">798</a> He had <i>climbed up</i> on a stone, and standing on
tip-toes, with outstretched neck, contemplating him with eyes and mind,
showed himself to him as a kind of new <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Zacchaeus.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">799</a> And it was not
hid from Malachy (for the Holy Spirit revealed it) that he had truly
come <i>in the spirit and power of</i> Zacchaeus.<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> He took no notice,
however, at the time, and passed on in silence. But in the hospice that
night he told the brothers how he had seen him and what he had foreseen
concerning him. But on the third day behold he came with a certain
nobleman, his lord, who disclosed the wish and desire of the young man,
and asked that he would deign to receive him on his commendation, and
have him henceforth among his companions. And Malachy recognizing him
said, "There is no need that man should commend him <i>whom</i> already <i>God
has commended</i>."<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> And taking him by the hand he delivered him over
to our abbot Congan<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> and he to the brothers. But that young
man&mdash;still living if I mistake not&mdash;the first lay conversus of the
monastery of the Suir,<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> has testimony from all that he lives a holy
life among the brothers, according to the Cistercian Order. And the
disciples recognized also in this incident that Malachy had <i>the spirit
of prophecy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> and not in this only, but in that which we shall add.</p>

<p>65. When he was offering the sacraments,<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> and the deacon had
approached him to do something belonging to his office, the priest
beholding him groaned because he had perceived that something was hidden
in him that was not meet. When the sacrifice was over, having been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>probed privately concerning his conscience <i>he confessed and denied
not</i><a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> that he had been <i>mocked</i><a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> in a dream that night. And
Malachy enjoined penance upon him and said, "It was your duty not to
have ministered to-day, but reverently to withdraw from sacred things
and to show respect to so great and divine mysteries, that purified by
this humiliation you might in future minister more worthily."</p>

<p>Likewise on another occasion,<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">808</a> when he was sacrificing and praying
at the hour of sacrifice with his accustomed sanctity and purity of
heart, the deacon standing by him, a dove was seen to enter through the
window in great glory. And with that glory the priest was completely
flooded, and the whole of the gloomy basilica became suffused with
light. But the dove, after flitting about for a while, at length settled
down on the cross before the face of the priest. The deacon was amazed;
and trembling on account of the novelty both of the light and of the
bird, for that is a rare bird in the land, fell upon his face, and
palpitating, scarcely dared to rise even when the necessity of his
office required it. After Mass Malachy spoke to him privately and bade
him, as he valued his life, on no account to divulge the mystery which
he had seen, as long as he himself was alive.</p>

<p>Once, when he was at Armagh with one of his fellow-bishops, he rose in
the night and began to go round the memorials of the saints, of which
there are many in the cemetery of St. Patrick,<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> with prayer. And lo,
they saw one of the altars suddenly take fire. For both saw this great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>vision, and both wondered. And Malachy, understanding that it was a sign
of the great merit of him, or those, whose bodies rested under that
altar, ran and plunged into the midst of the flames with outstretched
arms and embraced the sacred altar. What he did there, or what he
perceived, none knows; but that from that fire he went forth ablaze more
than his wont with heavenly fire, I suppose there is none of the
brothers who were with him then that does not know.</p>

<p>66. These things have been mentioned, a few out of many, but many for
this time. For these are not times of signs, as it is written, <i>We see
not signs; there is no more any prophet.</i><a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">810</a> Whence it appears
sufficiently how great in merits was my Malachy, who was so rich in
signs, rare as they now are. For in what kind of <i>ancient miracles</i><a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">811</a>
was not Malachy conspicuous? If we consider well those few that have
been mentioned, he lacked not prophecy,<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> nor revelation,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> nor
vengeance upon the impious,<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> nor <i>the grace of healings</i>,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> nor
transformation of minds,<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> nor lastly raising the dead.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> By all
these things God was blessed who so loved and adorned him, who also
magnified him <i>before kings</i>,<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> and gave him <i>the crown of
glory</i>.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">819</a> That he was loved is proved in his merits, that he was
adorned, in his signs, that he was magnified, in his vengeance on
enemies, that he had glory, in recompense of rewards. You have in
Malachy, diligent reader, something to wonder at, you have also
something to imitate. Now carefully note what you may hope for as the
result of these things. For <i>the end of these things is a precious
death</i>.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></p>

to have imprisoned illegally several persons of high position, viz. (1)
his own son Rory O'Conor, together with Donnell O'Flaherty and Cathal
O'Conor, in 1143, (2) Murrough Ua Maelsechlainn, king of Meath, in 1143,
and (3) Teague O'Brien, in 1148. Release was obtained, in the first
instance, in 1144 by the clergy of Ireland and the "coarb of Patrick,"
who fasted at Rathbrennan. The coarb may have been Malachy. In the
second instance, it was secured through the influence of certain
"sureties"; and in the third, "at the intercession of the bishops of
Ireland with the coarb of Patrick, Mael Maedoc Ua Morgair" (<i>A.F.M.</i>,

general, as has sometimes been assumed, but of stone oratories, which
may have been unknown in "that land," <i>i.e.</i> the district about Bangor
(see p. 32, n. 3). The innovation would naturally cause dissatisfaction
among a conservative people. Indignation may also have been excited by
the unusual size of the building; for it was "a great oratory" (&sect; 63).
But on the other hand, its ornate style cannot have contributed to the
opposition which the project aroused; for it commenced when the
foundations were being laid. Indeed, however "beautiful" it may have
been (&sect; 63), it was probably, like the churches of the Cistercians, of
simple design and devoid of ornament. See St. Bernard's <i>Apologia ad
Guillelmum</i>, &sect; 28 ff. (<i>P.L.</i> clxxxii. 914 f.). The only relic of the
medieval monastery of Bangor is a rudely built wall, once pierced by a
door and a window, now built up. It seems to be later than the twelfth
century. About 120 yards to the south-west of it is "The Abbey Church,"
still used for worship. The main part of this structure dates from the
seventeenth century. But the core of the tower appears to be much
earlier, and may be on the site of St. Malachy's oratory.</p></div>

there before St. Malachy's time. The text seems to imply that there were
no monastic buildings on the site when he founded (or re-founded) it.
Malachy placed in his new monastery a convent of regular canons of St.
Augustine (<i>A.U.</i> 1170); but it never became an important establishment,
though it was still in existence in the sixteenth century. See Reeves,
pp. 40, 220 ff.</p></div>

<p>67. (30). Being asked once, in what place, if a choice were given him,
he would prefer to spend his last day&mdash;for on this subject the brothers
used to ask one another what place each would select for himself&mdash;he
hesitated, and made no reply. But when they insisted, he said, "If I
take my departure hence<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">821</a> I shall do so nowhere more gladly than
whence I may rise together with our Apostle"<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">822</a>&mdash;he referred to St.
Patrick; "but if it behoves me to make a pilgrimage, and if God so
permits, I have selected Clairvaux." When asked also about the time, [he
named in reply] the festival of all the dead.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">823</a> If it is regarded as
a mere wish, it was fulfilled, if as a prophecy, not <i>a jot passed</i> from

and day. Let us relate briefly in what order and by what occasion it
came to pass. Malachy took it amiss that Ireland was still without a
pall; for he was zealous for the sacraments, and would not that his
nation should be wholly deprived of any one of them.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">826</a> And
remembering that it had been promised to him by Pope Innocent,<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">827</a> he
was the more sad that while he was still alive it had not been sent for.
And taking advantage of the fact that Pope Eugenius<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">828</a> held the chief
rule and was reported to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>have gone at that time to France,<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">829</a> he
rejoiced that he had found opportunity for claiming it. He took for
granted that, the Pope being such a man as he was, and having been
promoted from such a religious profession&mdash;and the more because he had
been a special son of his own Clairvaux&mdash;he need not fear that he should
have any difficulty with him. Therefore the bishops were summoned; a
council assembled.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">830</a> Matters which were of immediate importance at
the time were discussed for three days, and on the fourth the scheme of
obtaining the pall was broached. Assent was given, but on condition that
it should be obtained by another. However, since the journey was a
comparatively short one, and on that account the pilgrimage seemed more
easy to be endured, none presumed to oppose his counsel and will. And
when the council was dissolved Malachy started on his way.<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">831</a> Such
brothers as had come together followed him to the shore; but not many,
for he doubtless <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>restrained them. One of them, Catholicus by name, with
tearful voice and face, said to him, "Alas! you are going away; and in
how great, almost daily, trouble you leave me you are not ignorant, and
yet you do not, of your pity, give me help. If I deserve to suffer, what
sin have the brothers committed that they are scarcely allowed to have
any day or night free from the labour of caring for and guarding me?" By
these words and tears of his son (for he wept) the father's <i>heart was</i>
troubled,<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> and he embraced him with caresses, and making the sign of
the cross on his breast said, "Be assured that you will have no such
suffering till I return." Now he was an epileptic, and fell often;
insomuch that at times he suffered not once but many times a day. He had
been a victim to this horrible disease for six years; but at the word of
Malachy he made a perfect recovery. From that hour he has suffered no
such thing; no such thing, as we believe, will he suffer henceforth, for
henceforth Malachy will not return.</p>

<p>68. When he was just about to embark there <i>came unto him</i> two of those
who <i>clave unto him</i><a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> more closely, boldly <i>desiring a certain thing
of him</i>. And he said to them, <i>"What would ye?"</i><a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> And they answered,
"We will not say, except you promise that you will give it." He pledged
himself. And they said, "We would have you certainly promise of your
condescension, that you will return in good health to Ireland." All the
others also insisted upon it. Then he deliberated for a while, repenting
at first that he had bound himself, and not finding any way of escape.
He was <i>straitened on every side</i>,<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> while no way of safety presented
itself from both dangers&mdash;of forfeiting his wish and of breaking his
promise. It seemed at length that he should rather <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>choose that which
influenced him more strongly at the moment, and leave the rest to higher
guidance. He assented, sadly it is true; but he was more unwilling that
they should be made sad; and pledging himself as they wished, he went on
board the ship. And when they had completed nearly half the voyage
suddenly a contrary wind drove the ship back and brought it to the land
of Ireland again. Leaving the ship he passed the night in the port
itself in one of his churches. And he joyfully gave thanks for the
resourcefulness of the divine providence, by which it came about that he
had now satisfied his promise. But in the morning, he went on board, and
the same day, after a prosperous crossing, came into Scotland. On the
third day<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">836</a> he reached a place which is called Viride Stagnum;<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">837</a>
which he had caused to be prepared that he might found an abbey there.
And leaving there some of his sons, our brothers, as a convent of monks
and abbot<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">838</a> (for he had brought them with him for that purpose) he
bade them farewell and set out.</p>

<p>69. And as he passed on, King David met him, by whom he was received
with joy and was detained as his guest for some days.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> And having
done many things pleasing to God he resumed the journey that he had
begun. And passing through Scotland, at the very border of England he
went aside to the Church of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>Gisburn, where there dwell religious men
leading a canonical life,<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">840</a> familiar to him of old for their
religious conversation and honourable character. At that place a woman
was brought to him, suffering from a disease horrible to see, which is
commonly called cancer; and he healed her. For when water which he
blessed was sprinkled on the sores she ceased to feel pain. On the next
day scarcely a sore was to be seen.</p>

<p>Departing thence he came to the sea, but was refused passage. The
reason, if I am not mistaken, was that some difference had arisen
between the chief pontiff and the king of England: for the king
suspected in that good man I know not what evil, if he should cross the
sea;<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> for neither did he allow other bishops to cross.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">842</a> That
obstacle, though contrary to the will of Malachy, was not contrary to
the object of his wish. He grieved that the attainment of his desire
should be postponed, not knowing that by this it would be the rather
fulfilled. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>For if he had immediately passed over the sea he would have
been obliged to pass by Clairvaux in order to follow the chief Pontiff.
For by that time he had left it and was at or near Rome.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">843</a> But now
through this delay it was brought about that he crossed later, and so,
as was fitting, he came to the place of his most holy death, and at the
hour of its approach.</p>

<p>70. (37). And he was received by us, though he came from the west, as
the true <i>day-spring<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> from on high visiting us</i>.<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> O, how greatly
did that radiant sun fill our Clairvaux with added glory! How pleasant
was the festal day that dawned upon us at his coming! <i>This was the day
which the Lord had made, we rejoiced and were glad in it.</i><a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> As for

did I soon <i>run</i> to meet him! With what joy I <i>kissed him</i>! With what
joyful arms I <i>embraced</i><a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">848</a> this grace sent to me from heaven! With

days I spent with thee then, though few! But how did he in his turn
greet us? In truth our pilgrim showed himself cheerful <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>and kindly to
all, to all incredibly gracious. <i>How good and how pleasant</i><a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> a part
he played among us as our guest, whom, forsooth, <i>he had come from the
uttermost parts of the earth</i> to see, not that he should <i>hear</i>, but
that he should show us, a <i>Solomon</i>! In fact we <i>heard</i> his
<i>wisdom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> we had his presence, and we have it still.
<span class="sidenote">1148, Oct. 18</span>Already four
or five days of this our festival had passed, when lo, on the feast day
of Blessed Luke the Evangelist,<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> when he had celebrated Mass in the
convent<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> with that holy devotion of his, he was taken with a fever
and lay down in his bed: and all of us were [sick] with him. <i>The end of
our mirth is sorrow</i>,<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> but moderate sorrow, because for a time the
fever seemed to be slight. You should see the brothers running about,
eager to give, or to receive. To whom was it not sweet to see him? To
whom was it not sweeter to minister to him? Both were pleasant and both
salutary. It was an act of kindness to do him service, and it was repaid
also to each one of them, by the gift of grace. All assisted, all were
busied <i>with much serving</i>,<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> searching for medicines, applying
poultices, urging him often to eat. But he said to them, "These things
are without avail, yet for love of you I do whatever you bid me." For he
knew that <i>the time</i> of his departure was at hand.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">856</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>71. And when the brothers who had come with him<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">857</a> urged him more
boldly, saying that it behoved him not to despair of life, for that no
signs of death appeared in him,<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> he said, "It behoves Malachy to
leave the body this year."<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> And he added, "See, the day is drawing
near which, as you very well know, I have always desired to be the day
of <i>my dissolution</i>.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">860</a> <i>I know whom I have believed and am

led me to the place which I sought, will not deny me the time for which
I wished no less. As regards this mean body, <i>here is my rest</i>;<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> as

day</i><a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> in which so great benefits are bestowed by the living on the
dead."<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> Not far away was that day when he spoke thus. Meanwhile he
ordered that he should be anointed with the sacred oil. When the convent
of brothers was going out that it might be done solemnly,<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> he would
not permit them to come up to him; he went down to them. For he was
lying in the balcony<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> of the upper house. He was anointed; and when
he had received the viaticum, he commended himself to the prayers of the
brothers, and the brothers to God,<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> and went back to bed. He went
down from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>the high balcony<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">870</a> on his feet, and again, as if that were
not enough, he went up on his feet; yet he said that death <i>was at the
doors</i>.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> Who should believe that this man was dying? Himself alone
and God could know it. His face did not seem to have become pallid or
wasted. His brow was not wrinkled, his eyes were not sunken, his
nostrils were not thin, his lips were not contracted, his teeth were not
brown, his neck was not gaunt and lean, his shoulders were not bowed,
the flesh on the rest of his body had not failed. Such was the grace of
his body, and such the <i>glory of his countenance which was</i> not <i>to be
done away</i>,<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> even in death. As he appeared in life so was he also in
death, more like to one alive.</p>

<p>72. (38). Hitherto our story has run a rapid course; but now it stays
because Malachy <i>has finished his course</i>.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> He is still, and with
him we are still. Moreover, who would willingly hasten to [tell of]
death? Especially thy death, holy father, who could describe it? Who
would wish to hear the story? Yet we loved <i>in life, in death we shall
not be divided</i>.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> Brothers, let us not forsake in death him with
whom we companied in life. From further Scotland<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> he ran hither to
death; <i>let us also go and die with him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> I must, I must tell that
which of necessity I saw. The celebration, everywhere renowned, of All
Saints<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> comes, and according to the ancient saying, <i>Music in
mourning is an unseasonable discourse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> We come, we sing, even
against our will. We weep while we sing and we sing while we weep.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>Malachy, though he sings not, yet does not lament. For why should he
lament, who is drawing near to joy? For <i>us who remain</i>,<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">879</a> mourning
remains. Malachy alone keeps festival. For what he cannot do with his
body he does with his mind, as it is written, <i>The thought of man shall
confess to thee, and the residue of thought shall keep the day of
festival to thee.</i><a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">880</a> When the instrument of the body fails him, and
the organ of the mouth is silent, and the office of the voice ceases, it
remains that with songs in his heart he keeps festival. Why should not
the saint keep festival, who is being brought to the festival of the
saints?<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> He presents to them what will soon be due to himself. <i>Yet
a little while</i><a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> and he will be one of them.</p>

<p>73. Towards the dusk of night, when now somehow the celebration of the
day had been finished by us, Malachy had drawn near, not to dusk but to
dawn. Was it not dawn to him<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> for whom <i>the night is far spent and
the day is at hand</i>?<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> So, the fever increasing, a burning sweat from
within him began to break out over his whole body, that, as it were
<i>going through fire and through water, he might be brought into a
wealthy place</i>.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">885</a> Now his life was despaired of, now each one
condemned his own judgement, now none doubted that Malachy's word<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">886</a>
was prevailing. We were called; we came. And lifting up his eyes on
those who stood round him, he said, "<i>With desire I have desired to eat
this passover</i> with <i>you</i>;<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>give thanks to the divine compassion,
I have <i>not been disappointed of my desire</i>."<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">888</a> Do you see the man
free from care in death, and, not yet dead, already certain of life? No
wonder. Seeing that the night was come to which he had looked forward,
and that in it the day was dawning for him, so to speak triumphing over
the night, he seemed to scoff at the darkness and as it were to cry, "<i>I
shall</i> not <i>say, surely the darkness shall cover me</i>, because this
<i>night shall be light about me in my pleasure</i>."<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">889</a> And tenderly
consoling us he said, "Take care of me; if it be allowed me I shall not
forget you. And it shall be allowed. <i>I have believed in God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> and
<i>all things are possible to him that believeth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> I have loved God;

heaven</i><a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">893</a> he said, "O God, <i>keep them in Thy name</i>;<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">894</a> <i>and not
these</i> only <i>but</i> all them <i>also who through</i> my <i>word</i><a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> and
ministry have given themselves to thy service." Then, laying his hands
on each one severally and blessing all,<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> he bade them go to rest,
<i>because his hour was not yet come</i>.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">897</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1148, November 2</div>

<p>74. We went. We returned about midnight, for at that hour it was
announced that <i>the light shineth in darkness</i>.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> The house filled,
the whole community was present, many abbots also who had assembled.
<i>With psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</i><a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">899</a> we followed our
friend as he returned to his own country.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> In the fifty-fourth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>year of his age,<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> at the place and time which he had chosen
beforehand and predicted, Malachy, the bishop and legate of the holy
Apostolic See, taken up <i>by the angels</i>,<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">902</a> as it were from our
hands, happily <i>fell asleep in the Lord</i>.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">903</a> And indeed he slept.
His placid face was the sign of a placid departure. And verily <i>the
eyes of all were</i> fixed <i>upon him</i>;<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> but none could perceive when
he departed. When dead he was thought to be alive, when alive, dead;
so true was it that there was no difference which might distinguish
death from life. The same vivacity of face, the same serenity, as
commonly appears in one who sleeps. You might say that death robbed

such mourning is based on custom, not on reason. If the Lord <i>hath given

by St. Bernard at the request of Innocent II. and was appointed abbot of
the monastery of St. Anastasius. On the death of Lucius II. he was

Patrick, at which were present fifteen bishops and two hundred priests,
to establish rules and morals for all, both laity and clergy; and Mael
Maedoc Ua Morgair, by the advice of the Synod, went a second time to
Rome (<i>sic</i>) to confer with the comarb of Peter" (<i>A.F.M.</i> 1148).
Inispatrick is a small island off Skerries, co. Dublin. For the date see
<i>R.A.I.</i> xxxv. 249 f. In the same year Malachy had consecrated the
monastery of Knock (<i>A.F.M.</i> See p. 67, n. 3).</p></div>

sail immediately after the Synod, and from a port not far from the place
where it met. But this is impossible, for one day's sail brought him to
Scotland (&sect; 68). He seems to have embarked at Bangor, which is about a

the river Ribble, not far from the border of Lancashire. It is clear
that on this occasion Malachy followed the line of Watling Street, which
ran through Ribchester, on the Ribble, about fourteen miles from
Gisburn. His road probably passed within three miles of that place
between Settle and Chetburn. He seems to have avoided entering England
as long as possible&mdash;supposing no doubt, and with good reason, that he
was safer in the dominions of David than in those of Stephen. For
details of the journey see <i>R.I.A.</i> xxxv. 239 ff., 249. The monastery of
Gisburn, of which the ruins remain to the south of the parish church,
was founded for Augustinian canons, in 1129, by Robert de Brus (Dugdale,
vi. 1, 265 ff.).</p></div>

being an emissary of the supporters of the Empress Matilda. He had just
spent some days with David I., and with him and his stepson Waltheof he
was on terms of intimate friendship (&sect;&sect; 36, 40). King David invaded
England in the following year.</p></div>

prevent Theobald of Canterbury and other bishops from attending the
Council of Rheims in March 1148. But Malachy does not seem to have been
summoned to the Council, and he did not reach the Channel till long
after it was over (see next note).</p></div>

20 (Jaff&eacute;, p. 634). At this rate he might have been expected to reach
Rome by the end of July. About that time, therefore, we may conjecture
that Malachy was on the coast of Kent. Actually, the Pope was not near
Rome till he reached Viterbo on November 30 (<i>ibid.</i> 636). St. Bernard,
therefore, when he wrote this passage, was ignorant of his movements for
a considerable time before Malachy's death.</p></div>

presented him with a pastoral staff (Dugdale, vi. 2, p. xii.). In France
Malachy travelled alone&mdash;having been parted from his companions in
England&mdash;and probably on horseback (&sect; 36). He may, therefore, have left
England about September 30, and traversed the 270 miles from Wissant to
Clairvaux by October 14. He apparently intended to start for Rome on St.

St. Bernard appears to be right. For Malachy was made bishop of Connor

twenty-ninth birthday. <i>A.F.M.</i> give the date as 1124. But if he was

inspiration, "when the sacrifice was finished, changed the order of the
prayer and introduced the collect for the commemoration of saints who
were bishops instead of that which was used for the commendation of the
dead," anticipating, as we may suppose, Malachy's canonization. He then
devoutly kissed his feet (<i>V.P.</i> iv. 21).</p></div>

placed Malachy on a par with the great Cistercian, thereby revealing to
us the extraordinary impression which he made on the community (<i>V.P.</i>
v. 25). I owe the following translation of it to a friend: "Grant, O
Lord, thy never-failing bounty to the spiritual harvest of the Valley,
which thou didst deem worthy to illumine with two stars of such
surpassing brightness, so making it brighter in very truth even than in
name. Do thou guard the house wherein this twofold treasure is laid up
and guarded for thee. Be it also unto us according to thy word, that as
thy treasure is there so may thy heart be also; there too thy grace and
mercy: and may the favour of thy compassion for ever rest on all who are
gathered together in the self-same place in thy Name, which is above
every name, even as thou art over all, God blessed for ever.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Amen.</span>"</p></div>

confident that <i>the Spirit which</i> you have <i>from God</i><a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> bears

new, may advance with new accessions day by day. We commend to you our
sons, yea also yours, and the more earnestly because they are so far
removed from us. You know that, after God, all our trust was in you, in
sending them, because it seemed to us wrong not to fulfil the prayers of
your holiness. See, as becomes you, that with your whole heart of love
you embrace them and cherish them. In no wise for any cause let your
earnest care for them grow cold, nor let that perish <i>which thy right

<p>2. We have now indeed learned both from your letter and from the report
of our brothers<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> that the house is making good progress, [and] is
being enriched both in temporal and spiritual possessions.<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">969</a>
Wherefore we rejoice greatly with you and give thanks with our whole
heart to God and to your fatherly care. And because there is still need
of great watchfulness, because the place is new, and the land
unaccustomed to the monastic life, yea, without any experience of it,
<i>we beseech you in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">970</a> that you slack not your hand</i>,<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">971</a>
but perfectly accomplish that which you have well begun. Concerning our
brothers who have returned from that place,<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">972</a> it had pleased us well
if they had remained. But perhaps the brothers<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> of your country,
whose characters are less disciplined and who have lent a less ready ear
to advice in those observances, which were new to them, have been in
some measure the reason for their return.</p>

<p>3. We have sent back to you Christian, our very dear son, and yours. We
have instructed him more fully, as far as we could, in the things which
belong to the [Cistercian] Order, and henceforth, as we hope, he will be
more careful concerning its obligations.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">974</a> Do not be surprised that
we have not sent any other brothers with him; for we did not find
competent brothers who were ready to assent to our wishes, and it was
not our plan to compel the unwilling. Our much-loved brother,
Robert,<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> assented on this occasion also to our prayers, <i>as an
obedient son</i>.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">976</a> It will be your part to assist him that your house
may now be set forward, both in buildings and in other necessaries. This
also we suggest to your fatherhood, that you persuade religious men and
those who, you hope, will be useful to the monastery, to come into their
Order, for this will be of the greatest advantage to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>the house, and to
you they will pay the greater heed. May your holiness have good health,
being always mindful of us in Christ.</p>

<p class="subhead2a"><span class="smcap">To the Brothers in Ireland.</span> November 1148.<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">977</a></p>

<p class="subhead2a">(Epistle 374.)</p>

<p>To the religious brothers who are in Ireland, and especially to those
communities which Malachy the bishop, of blessed memory, founded,
Brother Bernard, called to be abbot of Clairvaux, [wishing them] <i>the
consolation of the Comforter</i>.<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">978</a></p>

<p>1. If <i>here we had a continuing city</i> we should rightly mourn with most
abundant tears that we had lost such a fellow-citizen. But if <i>we</i>
rather <i>seek one to come</i>,<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> as befits us, it is nevertheless no
small cause of grief that we are bereaved of a guide so indispensable.
We ought, however, to regulate passion with knowledge and to mitigate
grief with the <i>confidence of hope</i>.<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">980</a> Nor does it become any one to
wonder if love compels groaning, if desolation draws forth tears: yet we
must set a limit to these things, nay in no small measure be consoled
while we gaze <i>not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things
which are not seen are eternal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">981</a> First, indeed, we ought to rejoice
with the holy soul, lest he accuse us of want of charity, saying also
himself what the Lord said to the apostles, "<i>If ye loved me ye would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>rejoice because I go unto the Father.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">982</a> The spirit of our father
has gone before us to <i>the Father of spirits</i>,<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> and we are
convicted, not only as wanting in charity, but even as guilty of
ingratitude for all the benefits which came to us through him, if we do
not rejoice with him who has <i>departed</i> from labour to rest, from danger
to safety, from <i>the world unto the Father</i>.<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> Therefore, if it is an
act of filial piety to weep for Malachy who is dead, yet more is it an
act of piety to rejoice with Malachy who is alive. Is he not alive?
Assuredly he is, and in bliss. <i>In the eyes of the foolish he seemed to
have died; but he is in peace.</i><a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">985</a></p>

<p>2. Hence even the thought of our own advantage provides us with another
motive for great joy and gladness, because so powerful a patron, so
faithful an advocate has gone before us to the heavenly court.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> For
his most fervent charity cannot forget his sons, and his approved
holiness must secure <i>favour with God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">987</a> For who would dare to
suppose that this holy Malachy can now be less profitable [than before]
or less loving to his own? Assuredly, if he was loved aforetime, now he
receives from God surer proofs of His love, and <i>having loved his own,
he loved them unto the end</i>.<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">988</a> Far be it from us, holy soul, to
esteem thy prayer now less <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>effectual, for now thou canst make
supplication with more vigour in the presence of <i>the Majesty</i><a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">989</a> and
thou no longer <i>walkest in faith</i>, but reignest <i>in the sight</i> of
Him.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">990</a> Far be it from us to count that laborious charity of thine as
diminished, not to say made void, now that thou prostratest thyself at
the very fountain of eternal charity, quaffing full draughts of that for
the very drops of which thou didst thirst before. Charity, <i>strong as
death</i>,<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">991</a> yea even stronger than death itself, could not yield to
death. For even at the moment of his departure he was not unmindful of
you, with exceptional affection commending you to God, and with his
accustomed <i>meekness and lowliness</i><a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> praying our insignificance also
that we should not <i>forget you for ever</i>.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> Wherefore also we thought
good to write to you that you may know that we are ready to bestow upon
you all consolation with entire devotion, whether in spiritual things,
if in them our insignificance can ever do anything by the merits of this
our blessed father, or in temporal, if ever perchance opportunity should
be given us.</p>

<p>3. And now also, dearly beloved, we are filled with heartfelt pity for
this grievous bereavement of the Irish Church.<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> And we unite
ourselves the more with you in suffering because we know that by this
very thing we have become the more your debtors. For the <i>Lord did great
things for us</i><a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">995</a> when He deigned to honour this place of ours by
making it the scene of his blessed death, and to enrich it with the most
costly treasure of his body.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> But do not take it ill that he is
buried among us; for God so ordered, <i>according to the multitude of His
mercies</i>,<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">997</a> that you should possess him in life, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>that it might
be allowed to us to possess him, if only in death. And to us, indeed, in
common with you, he was, and still is, father. <i>For</i> even <i>in</i> his
<i>death</i> this <i>testament was confirmed</i> to us.<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> Wherefore as, for the
sake of so great a father, we embrace you all as our true brothers, with
the unstinted yearning of charity, so also concerning yourselves,
spiritual kinship persuades us that you are like-minded.</p>

<p>4. But we exhort you, brothers, that you be always careful to <i>walk in
the steps of</i> this <i>our</i> blessed <i>father</i>,<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">999</a> by so much the more
zealously as by daily proofs his <i>holy conversation</i><a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a> was more
certainly known to you. For in this you shall prove yourselves to be his
true sons, if you manfully maintain the father's ordinances, and if, as
you have seen in him, and heard <i>from him how you ought to walk, you so
walk that you may abound more and more</i>:<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> for the glory of a father
is the wisdom of his sons.<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a> For even for us the example of so great
perfection in our midst has begun in no slight degree both to expel our
sloth and impel us to reverence. And would that he may in such wise
<i>draw us after him</i> that he may draw us to the goal, <i>running</i> more
eagerly and more quickly in <i>the fragrance</i> which his virtues have left
so fresh behind them.<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> May Christ guard all of you <i>while you pray
for us</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a></p>

<h2>SERMONS OF ST. BERNARD ON THE PASSING OF MALACHY</h2>


<p class="subhead2"><span class="smcap">Sermon I</span></p>

<p class="subhead2">(November 2, 1148.)<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a></p>

<p>1. A certain abundant blessing, dearly beloved, has been sent by the
counsel of heaven to you this day; and if it were not faithfully
divided, you would suffer loss, and I, to whom of a surety this office
seems to have been committed, would incur danger. I fear therefore your
loss, I fear my own damnation,<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a> if perchance it be said, <i>The young
children ask bread, and no man offereth it unto them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a> For I know
how necessary for you is the consolation which comes from heaven, since
it is certain that you have manfully renounced carnal delights and
worldly pleasures. None can reasonably doubt that it was by the good
gift of heaven, and <i>determined by</i> divine <i>purpose</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> that Bishop
Malachy should fall asleep among <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>you to-day, and among you have his
place of burial, as he desired. For if not even a leaf of a tree <i>falls</i>
to <i>the ground without</i> the will of God,<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a> who is so dull as not to
see plainly in the coming of this blessed man, and his passing, a truly
great purpose of the divine compassion?<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> <i>From the uttermost parts
of the earth he came</i><a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a> to leave his earth here. He was hastening,
it is true, on another errand; but we know that by reason of his special
love for us he desired that most of all.<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a> He suffered many
hindrances in the journey itself, and he was refused permission to cross
the sea till the time of his consummation was drawing near,<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a> and
the goal which could not be passed. And when, with many labours, he came
to us <i>we received him as an angel of God</i><a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a> out of reverence for
his holiness; but he, out of his very deeply rooted <i>meekness and
lowliness</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a> far beyond our merits, received us with devoted love.
Then he spent a few days with us in his usual health: for he was waiting
for his companions, who had been scattered in England, when the baseless
distrust of the king was hindering the man of God. And when they had all
assembled to him, he was preparing to set out to the Roman Court, on his
way to which he had come hither;<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a> when suddenly he was overtaken by
sickness, and he immediately perceived that he was being summoned rather
to the heavenly palace, <i>God having <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>provided some better thing for us</i>,
lest going out from <i>us he should be made perfect</i> elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a></p>

<p>2. There appeared to the physicians no sign in him, I say not of death,
but even of serious illness; but he, gladdened in spirit, said that in
every way it was befitting that this year Malachy should depart from
this life.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a> We laboured to prevent it, both by earnest prayers to
God, and by whatever other means we could; but his merits prevailed,
that <i>his heart's desire should be given him and</i> that <i>the request of
his lips</i> should <i>not be withholden</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> For so all things happened
to him in accordance with his wishes; that by the inspiration of the
divine goodness he had chosen this place above all others, and that he
had long desired that he should have as the day of his burial this day
on which the general memory of all the faithful is celebrated.<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a>
Moreover, these joys of ours were worthily increased by the circumstance
that we had selected that same day, by God's will, for bringing hither
from the former cemetery for their second burial the bones of our
brothers.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> And when we were bringing them, and singing psalms in
the accustomed manner, the same holy man said that he was very greatly
delighted with that chanting. And not long after, he himself also
followed, having sunk into a most sweet and blessed sleep. Therefore we
render thanks to God for all the things that He has disposed, because He
willed to honour us, unworthy as we are, by his blessed death among us,
to enrich His poor with the most costly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>treasure of his body, and to
strengthen us, who are weak, by so great a <i>pillar</i><a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> of His church.
For one or other of two <i>signs</i> proves that it was <i>wrought for us for
good</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> either that this place is pleasing to God, or that it is
His will to make it pleasing to Him, since He led to it <i>from the
uttermost parts of the earth</i><a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a> so holy a man to die and to be
buried there.</p>

<p>3. But our very love for this blessed father compels us to sorrow with
that people from our heart, and to shudder exceedingly at the cruelty of
him, even Death, who has not spared to inflict this terrible wound on
the Church, now so much to be pitied. Terrible and unpitying surely is
death, which has punished so great a multitude of men by smiting one;
blind and without foresight, which has tied the tongue of Malachy,
arrested his steps, relaxed his hands, closed his eyes. Those devout
eyes, I say, which were wont to restore divine grace to sinners, by most
tender tears; those most holy <i>hands</i>, which had always loved to be
occupied in laborious and humble deeds, which so often <i>offered for</i>
sinners <i>the saving sacrifice</i><a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a> of the Lord's body, and were
<i>lifted up</i> to heaven in prayer <i>without wrath and doubting</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a>
which are known to have bestowed many benefits on the sick and to have
been resplendent with manifold signs; those <i>beautiful</i> steps also of
<i>him that preached the Gospel of peace and brought glad tidings of good
things</i>; those <i>feet</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> which were so often wearied with eagerness
to show pity; those footprints which were always worthy to merit devout
kisses;<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> finally, those holy <i>lips of the priest</i>, which <i>kept
knowledge</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a> <i>the mouth of the righteous</i>, which <i>spoke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>wisdom,
and his tongue</i> which, <i>talking of judgement</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a> yea <i>and of
mercy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> was wont to heal so great wounds of souls. And it is no

overcome by the Head, if it still rages with so great liberty against
the members? If death is dead, how did it kill Malachy? If it is

the fixed limits of its shores, death itself to the beloved of the Lord
is a sleep of refreshment. The prophet bears witness who says, <i>When he

<p>5. Let us rejoice therefore, brothers, let us rejoice as is meet, with
our father, for if it is an act of filial piety to mourn for Malachy who
is dead, yet more is it an act of piety to rejoice with Malachy who is
alive. Is he not alive? He is, and in bliss. Certainly, <i>in the eyes of
the foolish he seemed to have died; but he is in peace</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a> In fine,

<p>6. I think it right to relate to you, briefly, a specimen of the many
splendid deeds of this man, in which he is known to have <i>gone</i>, with no
little vigour, <i>through fire and water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a> A tyrannous race laid
claim to the metropolitan see of Patrick, the great apostle of the
Irish, creating archbishops in regular succession, and <i>possessing the
sanctuary of God by hereditary right</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a> Our Malachy was therefore
asked by the faithful to combat such great evils; and <i>putting his life

the archbishopric, exposing himself to evident danger, that he might put
an end to so great a crime. Surrounded by perils he ruled the church;
when the perils were passed, immediately he canonically ordained another
as his successor. For he had undertaken the office on this condition,
that when the fury of persecution had ceased and it thus became possible
that another should safely be appointed, he should be allowed to return
to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>his own see.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a> And there, without ecclesiastical or secular
revenues he lived in the religious communities which he himself had
formed, dwelling among them up to this time as one of themselves, and
abjuring all personal property.<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> So the fire of <i>affliction
tried</i><a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a> the man of God, but did not consume<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> him; for he was
gold. So neither did pleasure hold him captive or destroy him, nor did
he stand a curious spectator on the way, forgetful of his own
pilgrimage.</p>

<p>7. Which of you, brothers, would not earnestly desire to imitate his
holiness, if he dared even to hope for such an attainment? I believe,
therefore, you will gladly hear, if I perchance can tell it, what made
Malachy holy. But lest our testimony should seem not easy to be
received, hear what the Scripture says: <i>He made him holy in his faith
and meekness.</i><a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a> By faith he trampled on the world, as John bears
witness when he says, <i>This is the victory that overcometh the world,
even our faith.</i><a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> For <i>in the spirit of meekness</i><a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a> he endured
all things whatsoever that were hard and contrary with <i>good
cheer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a> On the one hand, indeed, after the example of Christ, by
faith he trampled on the seas,<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a> lest he should be entangled in

lest he should be crushed by troubles. For concerning these two things
you have the saying in the Psalm, <i>A thousand shall fall at thy side,
and ten thousand at thy right hand</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> for many more are cast down
by the deceitfulness of prosperity than by the lashes of adversity.
Therefore, dearly beloved, let none of us, allured by the level surface
of the easier way, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>suppose that road of the sea to be more convenient
for himself. This plain<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> has great mountains, invisible indeed, but
for that very reason more dangerous. That way perhaps seems more
laborious which passes through the steeps of the hills and the
ruggedness of rocks; but to them that have tried it, it is found far
safer and more to be desired. But on both sides there is labour, on both
sides danger, as he knew who said, <i>By the armour of righteousness on
the right hand and on the left</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a> so that we may rightly rejoice
with those that <i>went through fire and water and have been brought into

place</i>? Would that another might speak to you of it. For as for me, that
which I have not tasted I cannot indite.</p>

<p>8. But I seem to hear Malachy saying to me to-day about this <i>wealthy
place</i>, <i>Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt
bountifully with thee: for he hath delivered my soul from death, [mine
eyes from tears, and my feet from falling].</i><a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> And what I understand

because I am unwilling to tear myself away from the sweetness of the
father's name, and my tongue, dreading to be silent about Malachy, fears
to cease. The death of the soul,<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> my brothers, is sin; unless you

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>Threefold, then, is the rejoicing of the
man, since he is delivered from all sin, and from labour, and from

day of Malachy's death is cumulative. (1) The opening words of &sect; 1, and
the closing sentences of &sect; 8 (note "this day"). (2) The statement in &sect;
5, "He said <i>to us</i>, 'With desire I have desired,'" etc., implies that
those who tended Malachy in his sickness were present (see <i>Life</i>, &sect;
73). The first person plural in &sect; 2 suggests the same conclusion. (3) In
&sect; 6, "dwelling among them <i>up to this time</i>" implies that his death was
not long past. (4) The striking parallels with Letter iv.; for which see
the notes on it. (5) The tone of the sermon&mdash;in marked contrast to that
of Sermon ii.&mdash;indicates that the community was crushed with sorrow for
a recent bereavement. See <i>R.I.A.</i> xxxv. 255 ff.</p></div>

been made on All Saints' Day, the bones being reburied on All Souls'

of the construction of the new monastery of Clairvaux, which began

pierced by the hook thou hast imprudently swallowed, which saith in the
words of the prophet, 'O death, I will be thy death! O hell, I will be
thy bite.' Pierced, I say, by that hook, to the faithful who go through
the midst of thee thou offerest a broad and pleasant path-way into life"
(Morison's translation). A very old metaphor. It is thus explained by
Rufinus (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 400) in his Commentary on the Apostles' Creed (&sect; 16,
Heurtley's translation): "The object of that mystery of the Incarnation
... was that the divine virtue of the Son of God, as though it were a
hook concealed beneath the form and fashion of human flesh, ... might
lure on the prince of this world to a conflict, to whom offering His
flesh as a bait, His divinity underneath might secure him, caught with a
hook by the shedding of His immaculate blood.... As, if a fish seizes a
baited hook, it not only does not take the bait off the hook, but is
drawn out of the water to be itself food for others, so he who had the
power of death seized the body of Jesus in death, not being aware of the
hook of divinity enclosed within it, but, having swallowed it, he was
caught forthwith, and the bars of hell being burst asunder, he was drawn
forth as it were from the abyss to become food for others."</p></div>

anniversary of Malachy's death, <i>i.e.</i> on November 2, in a year later
than 1148. I put it in 1149 because of its striking coincidences with
the <i>Life</i>, which was written early in that year (see p. lxv). There is
also a possible echo (&sect; 3) of <i>De Cons.</i> i. which belongs to the same
year (<i>P.L.</i> clxxxii. 723). These, together with two coincidences of
phrase with other writings of St. Bernard, are pointed out in the notes.

<p class="subhead2">A.&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Bernard's Description of the State of the Irish Church.</span></p>

<p class="subhead2"><i>Life</i>, &sect;&sect; 7, 16, 17.</p>

<p>In two passages of the <i>Life</i> serious charges are made against the Irish
Church of the early years of the twelfth century. These charges refer
primarily to the dioceses of Armagh and Connor; but it is probable that
those dioceses were typical of many other districts throughout the
country. If St. Bernard's statements are true of them, they may be
applied with little reserve to the greater part of Ireland. Indeed he
himself gives us more than a hint that the abuses which he condemns were
by no means confined to eastern Ulster (&sect; 19). It may be well,
therefore, to bring them together and to discuss them.</p>

<p>1. There was no such thing as chanting at the canonical hours. In the
whole bishopric of Armagh "there was none who could or would sing" (&sect;
7). "In the churches [of Connor] there was not heard the voice either of
preacher or singer" (&sect; 16). We may suspect that there is some
exaggeration here; for if church song was absolutely unknown, how could
Malachy have "learnt singing in his youth" (&sect; 7)? But that St. Bernard's
remarks are substantially correct need not be questioned. He is not
speaking of the Irish Church as it was in its earlier period, but of its
state at the time when it had probably fallen to its lowest depth. His
assertion, therefore, is not disposed of by references to the chanting
at the funerals of Brian Boroimhe in 1014 and Maelsechlainn in 1022
(O'Hanlon, p. 34). Indeed in the notices of those events in <i>A.F.M.</i>
there is no express mention of ecclesiastical song.</p>

<p>2. At Armagh Confession was not practised (&sect; 7); in the diocese of
Connor "nowhere could be found any who would either seek penance or
impose it" (&sect; 16). It may be true that Confession had been much
neglected among some classes of the people: Malachy on one occasion met
a woman who had never confessed (&sect; 54), and the very fact that he put
the question to her "whether she had ever confessed her sins" suggests
that she was not singular in this respect. But it is remarkable that the
<i>anmchara</i> (soul-friend), or Confessor, is frequently mentioned in Irish
literature. The obits of several persons to whom that title is given are
recorded in the Annals in the twelfth century. And penance is often
alluded to in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>obituary notices of distinguished persons, clerical
and lay. In his sweeping statement St. Bernard may have had in mind some
differences of method in penitential discipline between the Roman and
Irish Churches.</p>

<p>3. The sacrament of Confirmation was not celebrated, at any rate in
Armagh (&sect; 7). This rite has always been used in the Irish Church, though
possibly neglected locally at some periods. St. Patrick tells us that he
"confirmed in Christ" those whom he had "begotten to God" (<i>Epistle</i>, 2;
cp. <i>Confession</i>, 38, 51)&mdash;thus giving us one of the earliest instances
in literature of the application to the rite of its present familiar
name. But in his practice (<i>Epistle</i>, &sect; 3), as in the Stowe Missal,
about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 800 (ed. Sir G. F. Warner, vol. ii. p. 31), it seems to have
consisted of an anointing with chrism without laying on, or raising, of
hand, or a direct prayer for the Holy Spirit. According to the Stowe
Missal it was administered by a presbyter. It is improbable that St.
Bernard or his romanizing friends would recognize the rite so performed
as true Confirmation.</p>

<p>4. One of the things which was neglected at Armagh was "the marriage
contract" (&sect; 7). In the diocese of Connor there was "no entry into
lawful marriages" (&sect; 16). By the labours of Malachy this abuse
disappeared. In Armagh he "instituted anew" the marriage contract; in
Connor it came to pass that "the celebration of marriage" was revived (&sect;
17). Putting these statements together we may conclude that St.
Bernard's meaning is that marriages had ceased to be celebrated in the
face of the Church, and that in consequence the vow of a life-long union
was often evaded. Now contemporary writers charge the Irish of this
period with loose sexual morality, especially in regard of arbitrary
divorce, matrimony within the prohibited degrees, exchange of wives, and
other breaches of the law of marriage. Such accusations are made, for
example, by Pope Gregory VII. (Haddan and Stubbs, <i>Eccl. Docs.</i> ii.
160), Lanfranc (Ussher, 490; <i>P.L.</i> cl. 535, 536), Anselm (Ussher 521,
523; <i>P.L.</i> clix. 173, 178) and Giraldus Cambrensis (<i>Gest.</i> ii. 14;
<i>Top.</i> iii. 19). Their evidence is the more worthy of credence because
the usages to which they refer were characteristic of the Irish at an
earlier period (<i>Encycl. of Religion and Ethics</i>, v. 456, 460), and
might be expected to recur in an age of spiritual decline. But both
Lanfranc and Anselm testify to the existence of marriage as an
institution among the Irish. The former speaks of the divorce of a wife
"lawfully joined to her husband," and the latter uses terms of similar
import. So also does St. Bernard himself. His praise of Malachy's mother
(<i>Life</i>, &sect; 1) is inconceivable if she did not live in wedlock; and he
expressly states that eight "metropolitans" of Armagh were "married men"
(&sect; 19). But if there was nevertheless a revival among large sections of
the people of pagan ideas of marriage, which tolerated polygamy,
concubinage, incest and easy termination of unions, it can be understood
that marriage in the face of the Church, which included a vow absolutely
prohibitive of all these things, would be commonly avoided. Malachy's
anxiety <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>to restore the marriage ceremony was no doubt due to a desire
to purge the nation of immoral customs of which St. Bernard makes no
express mention. But, however that may be, we have contemporary native
evidence that the rite of marriage had fallen into desuetude, and that
Malachy was successful in his effort to restore it. For in the document
quoted on p. 170, we are told that in a district which was part of the
diocese of Armagh when he was Cellach's vicar (<i>L.A.J.</i> iv. 37), and
under the rule of his patron, Donough O'Carroll, "marriage was assented
to."</p>

<p>5. "There was no giving of tithes or firstfruits," writes St. Bernard (&sect;
16). He is speaking of the diocese of Connor. But there is no doubt that
the remark might have been made of other districts. There was no such
custom as the payment of tithes in Ireland before the twelfth century.
They are first mentioned by Gilbert of Limerick, about 1108, in his <i>De
Statu Ecclesiae</i> (Ussher, 507); and they were enjoined at the Synods of
Kells in 1152 (Keating, iii. 315) and Cashel in 1172 (Can. 3, Giraldus,
<i>Expug.</i>, i. 35). From the document quoted above we learn that in Oriel,
under Donough O'Carroll, "tithes were received"&mdash;evidently a new impost.</p>

<p>6. "Ministers of the altar were exceeding few" in the diocese of Connor
(&sect; 16); and accordingly it is observed that Malachy provided his new
churches with clergy (&sect; 17). This is not proved, nor is it in any great
degree corroborated by the statement of <i>A.F.M.</i> (1148) that Malachy
"ordained bishops and priests and men of every order"; but the parallel
is perhaps worth noting.</p>

<p>7. The voice of the preacher was not heard in the churches (&sect; 16). This
statement cannot, so far as I know, be checked.</p>

<p>8. The same remark must be made about the statements that the people
would not come to church (&sect; 16), and that Malachy's exertions at length
induced them to do so (&sect; 17), though they are sufficiently probable.</p>

<p>9. That "churches were rebuilt" (&sect; 17) cannot be questioned. No doubt
the monasteries of Bangor and Saul would be counted among the number. We
have explicit and independent evidence of the fact. The foundation of
churches and re-edifying of monasteries were a conspicuous feature of
the reign of Donough O'Carroll (see p. 170). And <i>A.F.M.</i> (1148) lay
great stress on Malachy's activities in this direction. He "consecrated
many churches and cemeteries," and "founded churches and monasteries,
for by him was repaired every church in Ireland which had been consigned
to decay and neglect, and they had been neglected from time remote."</p>

<p>On the whole it appears that St. Bernard's strictures are at least not
without foundation in fact, in so far as they can be tested. But he can
scarcely be acquitted of some measure of exaggeration in the rhetorical
passages in which they occur.</p>

<p class="subhead2">B.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Hereditary Succession of the Coarbs Of Patrick</span>.</p>

<p class="subhead2"><i>Life</i>, &sect;&sect; 19. 20, 30.</p>

<p>The assertions of St. Bernard in <i>Life</i>, &sect; 19, concerning the coarbs of
Patrick are controlled by <i>A.U.</i> The ninth predecessor of Cellach,
Cathasach II. (&#8224; 957) is described in them (<i>s.a.</i> 956) as
"coarb of Patrick, learned bishop of the Goidhil." None of the following
eight is said to have been a bishop, though all are called coarbs of
Patrick. Moreover Cellach himself was appointed abbot before he
"received holy orders," and the record of his ordination on St.
Adamnan's Day (September 23) 1105, several weeks after his
"institution," seems to indicate that it was unusual for the abbots to
be ordained. All this corroborates the statement that his eight
predecessors were "without orders." It is true, indeed, that according
to <i>A.F.M.</i> Amalgaid, one of the eight, anointed Maelsechlainn king of
Ireland, on his deathbed in 1022. But it does not follow from this that
he was a priest. In early times, as is well known, unction was
administered to the sick by laymen; and there appears to be no evidence
that this office was confined to the priesthood till well on in the
ninth century (<i>Dict. of Christ. Antiquities</i>, ii. 2004). It is at least
possible that the older usage lingered on in Ireland to a much later
date than on the Continent. But the statement of <i>A.F.M.</i> as to the
anointing of Maelsechlainn is not confirmed by the more reliable
authority of <i>A.U.</i></p>

<p>That at least five of the eight were, as St. Bernard says, "married men"
is shown by the following table, compiled from <i>A.U.</i> and MacFirbis
(<i>R.I.A.</i>, MS. 23 P. 1, p. 308). The persons whose names are printed in
italics were coarbs of Patrick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gen.jpg" width="600" height="421" alt="coarbs of Patrick" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>This table also confirms the statement that the abbots all belonged to
the same family, and so obtained office by a sort of hereditary right.
St. Bernard gives no hint which would enable us to identify this family.
But the genealogy given by MacFirbis enumerates the ancestors of Cellach
in a direct line up to Fiachrach, son of Colla fo Crich, and is headed
"Genealogy of Ui Sinaich, <i>i.e.</i> the coarbs of Patrick." The Bodleian
MS., Rawl. B. 502,<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">1201</a> has the same genealogy, and entitles it
"Genealogy of Clann Sinaich." The family then from which the abbots of
Armagh were taken was the principal branch of that sept. From the
genealogy it appears that the sept was derived from Sinach, from whom
the fifth in descent was the Cellach whose name appears at the head of
foregoing table.</p>

<p>St. Bernard represents Malachy to have said in 1132, when he was induced
to oppose Murtough, that the system of hereditary succession had already
lasted nearly two centuries (&sect; 20). This statement is in accord with
known facts. The genealogical table gives sufficient evidence that it
began not earlier than the accession of Dubdalethe II. (965), and
continued to the accession of Murtough. If there is no evidence that the
three predecessors of Dubdalethe were of the Clann Sinaich, neither is
there anything to disprove it. But their immediate predecessor, Joseph,
was certainly not of that sept; for <i>A.U.</i> (<span class="smcap">ms.</span> A, 935) tells us that he
was of the Clann Gairb-gaela, and the list of coarbs in the Book of
Leinster notes in addition that he came from Dalriada (<i>R.I.A.</i> xxxv.
327, 359). Thus the succession cannot have been established before the
death of Joseph (936). Hence it lasted for a period of between 167 and
196 years. A period of 167 years, or a period of 196 years, might be
described as "well-nigh two hundred years" (<i>annos ferme ducentos</i>),
though the latter suits St. Bernard's language better than the former.</p>

<p>But how can this be harmonized with the statement that "fifteen
quasi-generations had passed in this wickedness" (&sect; 19)? Obviously a
"quasi-generation" is not a generation of human life: apart from the
facts just mentioned, the very word <i>quasi</i> forbids the supposition.
Colgan (<i>Trias</i>, p. 301) suggested that the word indicates the period of
office of a coarb; and this is very probable. The figure of generations,
so applied, is in line with St. Bernard's conception of a bishop as "the
seed" of his predecessor (&sect; 34). But the first of a series of coarbs, of
which Murtough was the fifteenth, was Maelcoba, the second predecessor
of Joseph. So that, even on Colgan's hypothesis, St. Bernard's two
statements are irreconcilable. Yet it is difficult to believe that an
error so manifest was in his source. I suggest that he wrote "fifteen"
in error for "twelve": in other words his document had <i>xii</i>, and he
misread it <i>xu</i>. The confusion of <i>u</i> with <i>ii</i> is very common in
manuscripts. If this explanation is accepted, St. Bernard's authority
implied that the hereditary succession was upheld without interruption
from the death <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>of Joseph to the accession of Murtough, which is
"well-nigh two hundred years."</p>

<p>This investigation may convince us that St. Bernard depended on an
excellent document for his knowledge of the history of Armagh. But he
certainly went astray in the interpretation of the document when he
styled the predecessors of Cellach metropolitans (see p. 45, n. 1). And
he goes further when he asserts that none were allowed to be bishops who
were not of their family (&sect; 19); thus leaving the impression that under
the rule of the eight lay abbots&mdash;that is, for a century and a
half&mdash;Armagh was deprived of episcopal ministrations. But this is wholly
unhistorical. The Ulster Annals mention six bishops of Armagh,
contemporary with the lay abbots. They seem to have followed one another
in regular succession, and there is no indication that any one of them
belonged to the Clann Sinaich. They were no doubt monastic bishops, such
as are found in the Irish Church from the sixth century onwards, who
exercised the functions of their order at the bidding of the abbots.
They were probably not referred to in St. Bernard's document; and if
they were, one who had been trained in an entirely different
ecclesiastical system would have been at a loss to understand their
position.</p>

<p>Thus we conclude that St. Bernard, in the passage which we are
considering, used good material with conscientious care, but that he was
misled by lack of knowledge of Irish ecclesiastical methods. This result
is important because it may apparently be applied to the whole of his
memoir of St. Malachy. His statements, as a rule, stand well the test of
comparison with the native records; and when he is at fault we can
usually explain his errors as misunderstandings, due to ignorance of
conditions of which he had no experience.</p>

<p>St. Bernard has been charged with gross exaggeration in another passage.
"A great miracle to-day," he writes (&sect; 30), "is the extinction of that
generation, so quickly wrought, especially for those who knew their
pride and power." It is an extravagant hyperbole to say that either the
O'Neills, or the great tribe of the Oirgialla, represented to this day
by the Maguires, the O'Hanlons and the MacMahons, was blotted out when
the <i>Life of St. Malachy</i> was written. So argued some in the time of
Colgan (<i>Trias</i>, p. 302). But they misrepresented St. Bernard. The word
"generation" obviously means in the sentence before us what it meant in
&sect; 19 ("adulterous generation")&mdash;not an extensive tribe, nor even the
Clann Sinaich as a whole, but the branch of that sept which provided
abbots for Armagh. The speedy extinction of a single family is not a
thing incredible. And it is worthy of remark that neither the Clann
Sinaich, nor any person described as ua Sinaich or mac Sinaich is
mentioned in the Annals after 1135 (see p. 58, n. 9).</p>

<p>The narrative of the series of events between the death of Murtough and
the consecration of Gelasius, both in St. Bernard's <i>Life</i> and in
<i>A.F.M.</i>, is obscure, and our two main authorities contradict each other
in some particulars. In this note, I propose to attempt a reconstruction
of the story.</p>

<p>1. Among the native authorities <i>A.F.M.</i> stand alone in giving what
approximates to a full account of the struggle between the rival abbots.
<i>A.T.</i> record only three incidents; the <i>Chronicon Scotorum</i> also
records three incidents belonging to the year 1134, and then breaks off,
to be resumed in 1142; in <i>A.U.</i> and <i>A.I.</i> there are hiatus which cover
the whole period; the other Annals ignore the events with which we are
concerned. The information supplied by <i>A.F.M.</i> runs as follows:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 10%;">


<p><span class="leftdate">1134.</span>(1) Malachy O'Morgair made a visitation of Munster and obtained his

was consecrated by a synod of clergy assembled at that place.</p>

<p>(3) Murtough died 17 September.</p>

<p>(4) Niall was installed in the coarbate of Patrick.</p>

<p>(5) A change of abbots at Armagh, <i>i.e.</i> Malachy O'Morgair in place of
Niall.</p>

<p>(6) Malachy afterwards made a visitation of Munster and received his
tribute.</p>




<p><span class="leftdate">1135.</span>(7) Flann Ua Sinaich, keeper of the Staff of Jesus, died after good
penance.</p>

<p>(11) Malachy O'Morgair resigned the coarbate of Patrick for the sake of

<p><span class="leftdate">1137.</span>(12) A change of abbots at Armagh, <i>i.e.</i> the erenach (<i>recte</i> abbot) of
Derry in place of Niall.</p>




<p><span class="leftdate">1138.</span>(13) Christian O'Morgair died.</p>
</div>

<p><i>A.T.</i> record the second and fifth of the above events, and subjoin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>to
the latter notice the passage quoted p. 51, n. 4. The <i>Chronicon
Scotorum</i> records, the second, third and fifth.</p>

<p>There is obvious confusion in the narrative of the Masters. They put the
death of Christian O'Morgair under 1138, which is a year too early (see
p. 66, n. 1), and they credit Malachy with having made three visitations
of Munster within three years, which he is very unlikely to have done.
But it is to be observed that the notices of the visitations are not
mere repetitions, for they differ from each other verbally. Thus we may
suspect that the Masters copied those entries from three different
sources, and that they refer to the same visitation, which, in at least
one of the sources, appeared under the wrong year. Now the consecutive
sentences 9, 10 are probably connected with each other: the absence of
Malachy in Munster would give his opponents opportunity to reinstate his
rival. In like manner entries 1, 2 (not consecutive) may be connected.
It would not be surprising if Malachy, even at some risk to the security
of his tenure of the abbacy at Armagh, took part in the consecration of
his patron's church at Cashel. And it may be added that he would not
improbably make this visit to the south the occasion of a circuit in
Munster. The visitation, on that hypothesis, must have taken place in
1134 or early in 1135. Again, the note of time in entry 6 implies that
it was made not very long after the appointment of Malachy, recorded in
the immediately preceding entry 5. Finally, entry 8 mentions an event
which must have greatly strengthened his hands. Having possessed himself
of the more important and revered of the abbatial insignia he was at
length more than a match for his antagonist. Probably, therefore, the
restoration of Niall (10) should be placed rather before than after it.
For these reasons we seem to be justified in placing the recorded
incidents in the following order. When Malachy secured possession of the
see (5) he remained long enough in Armagh to establish himself in the
abbacy. During this time may have occurred the abortive conspiracy
against him related in <i>A.T.</i>, but not alluded to in <i>A.F.M.</i> He then
went to Cashel for the consecration of the Chapel (2), and held his
visitation of Munster (1, 6, 9). When he returned he found that Niall
had once more entered Armagh (10). By July 1135 the power of his rival
had considerably decreased, and Malachy got possession of the Staff of
Jesus (8). Finally he resigned his office (11) and Gelasius was
appointed to it (12). If this is a true account of the course of events,
one statement of the Annals needs correction. They tell us that Gelasius
succeeded Niall; on our hypothesis he succeeded Malachy. But that the
Masters should have substituted the former for the latter was to be
expected; for according to their previous (as I believe misplaced)
statement Niall, not Malachy, was in possession in the latter part of
1136.</p>

<p>2. We now turn to St. Bernard's narrative of these transactions.
Sections 22 and 23 present no difficulty. They are simply an
amplification, with differences in detail, of what we learn from <i>A.T.</i>
In the early part of &sect; 24 it is stated that Malachy remained in Armagh
after the king, with whose aid he had "ascended the chair <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>of Patrick,"
had returned home; and in the succeeding narrative it is implied that he
never left it till he went to Down. That is to say, the visitation of
Munster is ignored. This need cause no surprise. It is quite possible
that St. Bernard had never heard of it. Again, there is no explicit
mention of the reinstatement of Niall. But it seems to be implied in &sect;
24 (see p. 53, n. 9). The whole story becomes more intelligible if we
assume that Niall was in possession for a short time, and then fled, but
continued to exercise his functions outside the city, as Malachy himself
had done in a previous period (&sect; 21). If we suppose that the visit to
Munster took place shortly after the episode of &sect; 23 we can explain the
only difficulty in the narrative, the return of Niall after he had been
driven out. The latter part of &sect; 24 seems to intimate a lessening of
opposition to Malachy's rule. The whole passage, &sect;&sect; 24-27, with the
exception of the last two sentences of &sect; 27, must relate to the period
before July 1135, inasmuch as Niall is represented as carrying about
with him the Staff of Jesus as well as the Book of Armagh.</p>

<p>Up to this point St. Bernard's narrative harmonizes admirably with the
story as it has been reconstructed above from the Annals. But we must
carry our comparison of the two accounts a little further. They agree in
giving 1137 as the date of the appointment of Gelasius as coarb of
Patrick; but while St. Bernard puts the resignation of Malachy in the
same year the Masters record it under 1136 (p. 61, n. 7). Now their
phrase (11), that he "resigned for the sake of God," in its present
context (10) can have only one meaning. Malachy, seeing that his contest
with Niall was hopeless, determined to retire rather than continue the
strife, and left Niall in possession. But apart from entry 10, which
seems to have been misplaced, the words have no such implication, and
are in harmony with the reason given by St. Bernard for Malachy's return
to his former diocese (&sect;&sect; 20, 21). Since the dates of the Masters for
this period are already suspect we need not hesitate to follow St.
Bernard's guidance here. But we may go further. The annalists were
compelled, if they would be consistent, to suppose that there was a
considerable interval between the retirement of Malachy and the
accession of Gelasius. How was it possible that when Niall had finally
routed his formidable rival, who was in possession of the Staff of
Jesus, another should at once step in and, apparently without any
difficulty, deprive him of the fruits of his victory? The difficulty is
increased if we accept the statement of St. Bernard&mdash;not contradicted by
the Annals, and not easy to dispute&mdash;that Gelasius was nominated by
Malachy himself, and was therefore presumably favourable to his cause.
Thus we perceive that there was good reason that the annalists should
separate the two events as far as possible, by antedating Malachy's
resignation, and by connecting it rather with Niall's restoration than
with the appointment of Gelasius.</p>

<p>3. In weighing the respective claims of St. Bernard and the annalists to
credence in this part of Malachy's life it is well to remember that of
it St. Bernard may be assumed to have had full and first-hand
information. The main facts were probably communicated <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>to him by
Malachy himself, though some particulars were no doubt added by other
Irish informants. It is true, we must also allow for bias on St.
Bernard's part in favour of his friend. Such bias in fact displays
itself in &sect;&sect; 25, 26. But bias, apart from sheer dishonesty, could not
distort the whole narrative, as it certainly must have been distorted in
the <i>Life</i>, if the narrative of <i>A.F.M.</i> is to be accepted as it stands.</p>

<p>4. It is important to observe that in the earlier stages of Malachy's
conflict with Niall the lord of Oriel was Conor O'Loughlin, who was
apparently not friendly to the reformers of the Irish Church (cp. &sect;&sect; 18,
20, p. 40, n. 2, and p. 46, n. 5). No doubt his defeat by O'Brien and
Mac Carthy in 1134 (p. 43, n. 5) made him a less ardent supporter of
Niall than he had been of Murtough; but it is not likely that he
entirely discouraged his attempts to seize the abbacy. The ultimate
success of Malachy was in fact probably due to O'Loughlin's murder at
the end of May 1136 and the rise to power of Donough O'Carroll (see p.
58, n. 11), his successor in the kingdom of Oriel. St. Bernard never
mentions O'Carroll by name, though he possibly alludes to him in one
passage (&sect; 28: see note there). But we may infer from other sources that
he was a zealous friend and helper of Malachy. The most important of
these is a contemporary document, part of which has been copied on a
blank page of a fourteenth-century Antiphonary of Armagh (T.C.D. ms. B.
1. 1.) opposite the first page of the Calendar. Unfortunately the scribe
laid down his pen at the end of a line and in the middle of a sentence.
The document was first published by Petrie (p. 389) with a translation.
As it is referred to several times in the notes to the <i>Life</i> it may be
well to print here, with a few slight alterations, Dr. Whitley Stokes'
revised rendering (Gorman, p. xx.).</p>

<p>"<i>Kalend. Januar. v feria, lun. x. Anno Domini mclxx.</i> A prayer for
Donnchad Ua Cerbhaill, supreme King of Oirgialla, by whom were made the
book of Cnoc na nApstal at Louth and the chief books of the order of the
year, and the chief books of the Mass. It is this illustrious king who
founded the entire monastery both [as to] stone and wood, and gave
territory and land to it for the prosperity of his soul in honour of
Paul and Peter. By him the church throughout the land of Oirgialla was
reformed, and a regular bishopric was made, and the church was placed
under the jurisdiction of the bishop. In his time tithes were received
and marriage was assented to, and churches were founded and temples and
bell-houses [round towers] were made, and monasteries of monks and
canons and nuns were re-edified, and <i>nemheds</i> were made. These are
especially the works which he performed for the prosperity [of his soul]
and reign in the land of Oirgialla, namely, the monastery of monks on
the banks of the Boyne [as to] stone and wood, implements and books, and
territory and land, in which there are one hundred monks and three
hundred conventuals, and the monastery of canons of Termann Feichin, and
the monastery of nuns, and the great church of Termann Feichin, and the
church of Lepadh Feichin, and the church of...."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>O'Carroll, then, was an ardent supporter of Malachy. Is it likely that
after his long struggle to secure the Chair of Patrick, and when he was
in actual possession of it, Malachy should voluntarily surrender his
claim to Niall at the very moment when the new king of Oriel had come to
his aid? Yet, unless we are prepared to place his resignation before
June 1136, that is the assumption we must make if we adhere to the
statements of <i>A.F.M.</i></p>

<p>5. There are other documents of high authority which must be taken into
account: the contemporary record of the succession of coarbs of Patrick
in the Book of Leinster, and the copy of a similar record in the Yellow
Book of Lecan. The former of these seems to have been written by a
partizan of Malachy, since it ignores Murtough. The latter assigns to
that abbot a rule of three years, in agreement with St. Bernard (&sect;&sect; 20,
21). But neither of them so much as mentions Niall; and both make
Gelasius the successor of Malachy. Thus they contradict <i>A.F.M.</i> and
corroborate the narrative of St. Bernard. See <i>R.I.A.</i> xxxv. 355 f.</p>
